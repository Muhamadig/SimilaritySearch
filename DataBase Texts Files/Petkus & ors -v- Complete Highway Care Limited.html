             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The appellants were all employees of the respondent at the relevant time. The employees allege that the respondent unlawfully deducted 10% from their wages and withdrew a bonus. The employer claimed that due to very difficult economic trading conditions for the respondent that a reduction in wages took place. This commenced in 2009 and that the bonuses were dispensed with in 2010. The appellants made a claim to the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission covering a period from March 2011 to September 2011. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The Rights Commissioner by decision of 30th April, 2013, decided that there was a breach of s. 5 of the Payment of Wages Act 1991, in that the 10% deduction in their pay was illegal.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The Rights Commissioner found that there was no illegal deduction with regard to the bonus and this portion of the claim failed. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. The respondent appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Tribunal in its decision of 13th January, 2005, stated:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">“The Tribunal recognises the inherent difficulty in differentiating a reduction from a deduction. A deduction or reduction of 10%, as in this case, has different implication on the respondent’s statutory liabilities. A deduction of 10% would not alter the respondent’s statutory liabilities i.e. PRSI, USC, PAYE. However, a reduction does alter their statutory liabilities. It is clear from the payslips exhibited, the respondent’s statutory liabilities were altered and, therefore, the Tribunal can only conclude that the 10% adjustment was a reduction. The Act does not apply to a reduction. On that basis, the Tribunal upsets the decisions of the Rights Commissioner under the Payment of Wages Act 1991, cancel the awards made to the respondents.”</font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Edwards J., 30th November, 2010) [2010] IEHC 461, was relied on by the respondent at the Rights Commissioner hearing. The Rights Commissioner, in his decision, took the view that this case concerned expenses and, therefore, it did not refer to wages properly payable as defined in the Payment of Wages Act and thus, did not rely on that judgment. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. In the relevant contract of employment governing the relationship between the appellants and the respondent, there is no specific reference to the right to deduct wages except at para. 20 where it states “changes to terms of employment, the company reserves the right to make reasonable changes to any of your terms and conditions of employment set out in this contract description and should this occur you will be notified in advance in writing of the nature and date of the change subject to consultation.” </font><br> </p>

               <font size="2" face="Verdana">“Finally, the Court agrees with the respondents’ submission that the Payment of Wages Act, 1991 has no application in the circumstances of this case. First, as has been pointed out, correctly in the Court’s view, the reduction in the PDF allowance is not a ‘deduction’ from wages payable. It is a reduction of the allowance payable. The Act has no application to reductions as distinct from ‘deductions’. Secondly, even if that were not so, any alleged breach of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991 is not a justiciable controversy before the High Court in circumstances where that Act sets up a specific enforcement mechanism to be availed of elsewhere in such circumstances.”</font>

               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McKenzie</font></i>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> is distinguishable from the facts of the present case in a number of respects. The Court accepts the submissions of the respondents that the remarks of Edwards J. in relation to ‘reduction v. deduction’ issue were obiter. Furthermore, </font>

               <font size="2" face="Verdana">related to the reduction in an allowance payable in respect of motor travel and subsistence. The definition of ‘wages’ in the 1991 Act expressly excludes any payment in respect of expenses incurred by the employee in carrying out his employment and so the finding by Edwards J. that the ‘RDF Allowance’ did not come within the scope of a deduction under the Act relates to an entirely different situation to that the present case where employees salaries were reduced. I am satisfied therefore that the Tribunal was entitled to proceed to consider the complaints on the basis that the reduction to the employees wages in the present case may have constituted a deduction in breach of the 1991 Act.”</font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> case. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. This Court can see no reference in the papers placed before the Employment Appeals Tribunal of any argument in relation to statutory liabilities of PRSI, USC and PAYE which was a reason for the Tribunal’s differentiation between deduction and reduction. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. The determination of the EAT is silent on the McKenzie case although the supplementary submissions of the appellants specifically address same. The decision of the Rights Commissioner’s was detailed and rejected it as a precedent.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. The determination did not summarise the evidence adduced by the appellants and the respondent, and did not comprehensively and concisely deal with any issues as to fact, nor did not summarise the legal materials put forward by either party.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21. The entire decision of the Rights Commissioner was under appeal including the failure of the Rights Commissioner to find in favour of the appellants that a bonus was improperly withheld and came within the parameters of Section 5 of the Payment of Wages Act 1991. This was not addressed in the Tribunal decision. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22. The Tribunal did explain this differentiation between a reduction and a deduction. It seems to have followed the obiter comment of Edwards J in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McKenzie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, but did not set out any of the legal arguments on how it came to differentiate the legal arguments and make its decision. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">23. Unfortunately, the McKenzie case has caused particular confusion to the determinations of Employment Appeals Tribunal and Rights Commissioners on the issue of Section 5 of the Payment of Wages Act 1991. This is clear from a number of decisions which have been furnished to the court as follows:-</font> </p>

              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">24. The EAT determination the subject of this statutory appeal in the opinion of this Court, falls a long way short of the standard this Court would expect in detailing the arguments that have been made and giving reasons, and explaining its decision.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">25. I do not accept that the determination of the tribunal, that there was a reduction of wages as distinct from a deduction, is a pure question of fact. It is a mixed question of law and fact. The basis of the conclusion was that a reduction as distinct from a deduction altered the Respondents statutory liabilities. Because an Employer arbitrarily reduces the wages of an employee, without the consent of the employee, and alters the amount of PAYE, PRSI, and USC accordingly does not necessarily remove the reduction from the jurisdiction of the Payment of Wages act 1991, entitling the Employer to ignore it’s provisions. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">26. It is not a matter for this Court to decide the substantive issue, but for the relevant decision making body set up under the Payment of Wages Act 1991 if a reduction is allowed at all pursuant to the provisions of s. 5 of the Payment of Wages Act 1991, without the consent of an employee. It is unfortunate that an obiter sentence in a judgment of this Court which did not relate to the payment of wages at all and which was put into practice by way of statutory instrument has caused such confusion. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27. The judgment of Kearns P. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Earagail Eisc Teoranta v. Doherty</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of 5th June, 2015, has clarified that issue. The </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McKenzie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> case is not precedent to allow a reduction of wages which does not offend s. 5 of the Payment of Wages Act 1991. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">28. The court is satisfied that the appellants are entitled to succeed in relation to para. (h) of their notice of motion, that is that the Employment Appeals Tribunal fell into an error of law in failing to consider the entirety of the circumstances of the matter and failed to properly consider or apply the correct interpretation and intention of that legislation protecting the payment of wages of workers under the Act and the Constitution.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">29. It is, therefore, appropriate to allow the appeal and remit the matter back to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for further determination.</font> </p>
