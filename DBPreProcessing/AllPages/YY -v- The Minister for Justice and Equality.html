<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Richard Humphreys delivered on the 13th day of March, 2017</font></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.	The present judicial review arises on unusual facts. When rejecting the applicant&#8217;s claim for subsidiary protection, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal made a finding, without clearly identifiable reasons and on limited material, that the applicant was at risk of serious harm if returned to his country of origin. However on a subsequent assessment of further more up-to-date and more detailed material and of the applicant&#8217;s personal circumstances, the Minister took a contrasting view that such risk had not been made out, and made a deportation order (and subsequently declined to revoke it). The validity of those ministerial decisions is now put in issue by the applicant. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Facts</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	The applicant was born in 1964 in a territory which, given the possible need to safeguard the applicant&#8217;s identity in the context of his claim of risk of torture, I will refer to as Country X.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	He was accused of involvement in terrorist Islamist opposition in Country X and was convicted of a number of terrorism-related offences, for which he was sentenced to three life sentences and two death sentences as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)	on 16th May, 1996, for forming an armed terrorist group intending to spread murder and sabotage, forethought deliberate murder, attempted assignation, arson and theft;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	on 23rd December, 1996, for the crimes of forethought deliberate murder, forming an armed terrorist group intending to harm the security of the country and its authorities and possession of war weapons;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	on 21st September, 1997, for forming an armed terrorist group, forethought deliberate murder, and possession of prohibited war weapons;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv)	on 8th November, 1997, for forming an armed terrorist group, for forethought deliberate murder, assistance of an armed terrorist group and failure to report;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v)	on 18th November, 1997, for forming an armed terrorist group intending to harm the security of the country and forethought deliberate murder. </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">4.	The applicant arrived in the State on 15th July, 1997, and applied for asylum under the false name of a Mr. B.D. He completed a fraudulent application for refugee status on 28th July, 1997, and continued to give false evidence in a s. 11 interview with the Refugee Applications Commissioner on 11th November, 1998. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5.	In the original application for asylum, the applicant falsely stated in his questionnaire that his parents and brother were killed in a raid by extremists and that his sister was arrested, and that after the raid he was shot in the leg by government forces. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6.	His application for asylum was rejected by the commissioner and he appealed to the tribunal. Again, his notice of appeal and evidence at the hearing on 10th November, 1999 were fraudulent. The tribunal was taken in by his falsehoods and allowed the appeal on 2nd April, 2000, and the applicant was granted a declaration of refugee status.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.	The Minister issued a travel document to the applicant on 10th October, 2000. Thereafter, the applicant left the State, although he may have returned on or about 22nd August, 2001 to renew the travel document.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8.	The applicant was arrested in Andorra for fraud offences in 2001 and was released on bail. I have not been given any information about whether this bail was honoured.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9.	He entered France in 2002 and was arrested on 23rd July, 2002, by the French Directorate of Territorial Safety as he sought to leave France for the United Kingdom.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10.	Criminal proceedings were then brought against the applicant in France and on 29th November, 2005, he was sentenced by the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris to eight years of imprisonment for terrorist-related activities, together with a lifetime ban from France.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11.	The applicant was convicted in France of the following offences: </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)	membership of a criminal organisation preparing an act of terrorism, committed in England, Ireland, Spain, Andorra and France between 1997 and 2002;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	terrorism/fraudulent detention of numerous false administrative documents, committed in Marseille in 2001 and 2002;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	 terrorism/use of a false administrative document which indicates a right, an identity or an occupation, committed in Marseille in 2001 and 2002;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv)	 receiving stolen goods, committed in Marseille in 2001 and 2002; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v)	illegal entry or illegal stay of a foreigner in France, committed in Marseille in 2001 and 2002.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">12.	The applicant&#8217;s brothers G.Y. and C.Y. were before the French court at the same time, a matter to which I will return.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13.	Following the expiry of the sentence, the French authorities made arrangements to deport the applicant to Ireland. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14.	Prior to his deportation, he applied for refugee status in France on 9th January, 2009, in the name of a Mr. B.D. That application was refused on 22nd January, 2009. While his Irish refugee application had said that he was not involved with any political grouping, his French asylum application stated that he was a sympathiser of a particular Islamic political movement in 1990, and that between 1990 and 1992 he was questioned three times by the authorities following raids.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15.	The response of the Irish authorities to developments was that by letter dated the 10th February, 2009, the Minister issued a proposal to revoke the applicant&#8217;s Irish refugee status. The applicant made representations in relation to the proposed revocation of his declaration as a refugee in March and December, 2009, in which he admitted providing a false identity during the asylum process and involvement in criminality in Andorra. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16.	In January, 2010, the applicant wrote to the Minister requesting a temporary identification card, and stating, fraudulently, that he had been issued with refugee status in France in 2000. By this time, the applicant had re-entered the State at some point during 2009. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17.	On 1st September, 2010, the applicant was convicted in absentia in the Criminal Court of Verdun for non-compliance with a residence order for non-nationals faced with deportation. He was sentenced to 6 months&#8217; imprisonment in relation to this offence. That sentence appears to be outstanding. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18.	On 17th May, 2011, the Minister withdrew the proposal to revoke the applicant&#8217;s refugee status and issued a fresh proposal on the basis of the provision of materially false and misleading information. The applicant made further representations on 21st June, 2011. The applicant&#8217;s refugee status was duly revoked on 5th August, 2011. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19.	The applicant brought an appeal to the High Court against that decision [277 MCA/2011]. In addition, he brought judicial review proceedings seeking to quash the revocation decision [2011 No. 816 JR]. These proceedings came on before Clark J. on 23rd February, 2012. On that date the applicant withdrew the appeal proceedings with an order for the respondent&#8217;s costs. The judicial review proceedings were struck out with no order. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20.	On 5th March, 2012, the respondent issued a proposal to deport the applicant under s. 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999. The applicant made submissions in relation to that proposal on 27th March, 2012, and made an application for subsidiary protection. In that application, he referred to criminal convictions in France but did not disclose such convictions in Country X. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21.	On 17th July, 2014, he applied for permission to re-enter the protection process under s. 17(7) of the Refugee Act, 1996. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22.	The application to re-enter the asylum process was refused on 18th September, 2014, on the basis that there was no evidence that persons found guilty of terrorist activities in Country X have been executed since 1993. The analysis also noted that the applicant appeared to have a further identity previously unknown to the Department. It noted contradictions between the applicant&#8217;s original asylum application and his statement now, that two of his brothers received wrongful convictions in relation to terrorist offences. These matters were held to undermine the applicant&#8217;s credibility. The s. 17(7) refusal was not challenged, other than that he wrote seeking a review of the decision in November, 2014, which was refused. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">23.	The applicant attended for interview in connection with his subsidiary protection on 2nd February, 2015. That is a crucial interview in the context of the present application. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">24.	The applicant stated in response to Q48 as set out in the report of the interview that his brother had been deported from France to Country X after the brother had served his sentence for terrorist offences in the former country. (One can note in passing that this clearly meant that the French did not consider the brother at risk of refoulement. It does not at all follow (as suggested by a sort of strained expressio unius argument advanced on behalf of the applicant) that they did consider the applicant to be at such risk, because that decision never came to be made due to the applicant unlawfully fleeing France). </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">25.	Q50 was &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Does [your brother] have any problems there now?&#8221; The reply was &#8220;When he went back to [Country X] they were asking him a lot about where am I and what had become of me but my family came to harm because of me and it affected the business and way of life. My brother is ok though I think</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (see Subsidiary Protection Report interview, p. 8).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">26.	The applicant made further submissions on 5th February, 2015. The commissioner reported on 21st July, 2015 to the effect that substantial grounds had not been shown for believing that the applicant would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to Country X, and in addition that he was excluded from international protection by virtue of reg. 17 of the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations, 2013 by reason of his offending behaviour. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27.	The report of the commissioner noted that despite the death sentences against the applicant, the authorities in a number of identified countries, including Country X, continued to impose death sentences but not to carry out executions, and accordingly the applicant was not in fact at risk of serious harm arising from the sentence. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">28.	In relation to prison conditions, the report of the commissioner stated that</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;there does not appear to be any country of origin information which would support a finding that the applicant would be at risk of suffering torture/inhuman treatment or punishment/degrading treatment or punishment in prison in [Country X]. It is also noted that no reference is made to poor prison conditions in the latest [Country X] Country Report issued by Human Rights Watch&#8221;, citing that body&#8217;s &#8220;World Report, 2015 &#8211; [Country X]&#8221;. Furthermore it was not accepted that there was a risk arising from a situation of indiscriminate violence. </font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">29.	The applicant&#8217;s involvement in a terrorist organisation or in terrorist activities was regarded as a &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">very serious offence</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; and it was held that he &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">could constitute a danger to the security of the State</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. His assertion that he was wrongly convicted of the crime was found to be not credible. Accordingly he was held to be excluded from protection. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">30.	The applicant filed a notice of appeal to the tribunal on 9th August, 2015, and delivered legal submissions on 7th January, 2016. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">31.	The tribunal (Mr. Conor Gallagher, B.L.) affirmed the recommendation of the commissioner that the applicant should not be granted subsidiary protection. However he did so on the basis of the exclusion clause, rather than on the basis that there was no risk of harm. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">32.	In relation to the death penalty, the tribunal noted that the death penalty had not been carried out in Country X in a number of years. The tribunal considered that it was &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">notable</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; that the applicant&#8217;s brother, who was sentenced to 5 years in France, was &#8220;living &#8216;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ok</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8217; </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">in [Country X]</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; according to the applicant.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">33.	While it was &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">conceivable that the [applicant] will be arrested by the authorities in [Country X]</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, the complaint made in relation to prison overcrowding did not reach a threshold such as to require subsidiary protection. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">34.	The tribunal concluded rather baldly at p. 18 of its decision that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">there is a personal, present, foreseeable and substantial risk of serious harm by the [Country X] authorities. That is not to say that it is probable that he will be tortured or that his fundamental human rights will be abused by the [Country X] authorities, simply that there are substantial grounds for believing so. For the avoidance of doubt, imprisoning the [applicant] following a fair trial for an offence would not constitute serious harm</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. However it is not at all apparent as to how the tribunal arrived at that conclusion, particularly where it had rejected the claims based on the death penalty and on treatment in prison, and noted that the applicant&#8217;s brother was not being subjected to serious harm. The tribunal&#8217;s conclusion seems, with every respect, to be lacking in reasons and in clear grounding in specifically-identified country material, as well as appearing irrational given the rejection of the applicant&#8217;s case regarding ill-treatment in prison. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">35.	On foot of the refusal of subsidiary protection, the applicant was informed that his entitlement to remain in the State had expired and that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order against him. Representations under s. 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 were made on 22nd April, 2016. A deportation order was made on 15th September, 2016, notified to the applicant on 19th September, 2016. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">36.	The accompanying analysis noted the history of the matter and the representations made on behalf of the applicant. The analysis notes a submission from the applicant&#8217;s current solicitors that the Minister was obliged to consider the personal circumstances of the applicant and country of origin material. The submission considered the reports submitted by the applicant, namely:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)	Human Rights Watch &#8211; World Report 2015 - Country X;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	United States Department of State Country X Human Rights Report;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	Material from United States Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour referring to &#8220;unrecognised&#8221; detention facilities; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv)	U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices, 2011. </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">37.	In addition, the Minister considered further country of origin information as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)	Country X 2014 Human Rights Report, U.S. Department of State;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	Amnesty International Report, 2015/16 &#8211; The state of the world&#8217;s human rights &#8211; Country X;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	U.K. Border Agency Report, 17th January, 2013; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv)	U.S. State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2015 &#8211; Country X.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">38.	Reliance was placed in particular on the U.K. Border Agency Report which indicated that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">human rights issues are being continually addressed and mechanisms for redress do exist</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. The U.K. Border Agency Report was also relied on in relation to measures to alleviate overcrowding in prisons, as well as information that persons in custody received visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross. The U.S. State Department Country Report of 2015 also took the view that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prison and detention center conditions generally met international standards</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. International monitoring was also noted in that report, as well as improvements in the system. The U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2014 reinforced the view that prison conditions generally met international standards.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">39.	The U.K. Home Office Report, Country X, March, 2011 stated that Islamist leaders had been released from prison in Country X and that an amnesty issued.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">40.	The Freedom House Report, Freedom in the World 2009 country report on Country X also noted the general amnesty and release of Islamist leaders from prison.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">41.	The conclusion of the analysis was that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">it is submitted that this therefore provides for the possibility that the [Country X] judgments would not be acted upon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, and that while prison capacity and overcrowding was &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">an issue</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, refoulement did not arise and there were redress mechanisms. Mr. Michael Lynn S.C. (with Mr. David Leonard B.L.) in the course of an able submission for the applicant, criticises the analysis for referring to the &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">possibility</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (rather than likelihood) that the judgment would not be acted upon, a matter to which I will return.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">42.	The analysis also rejected any risk arising from the death sentences on the same basis as the commissioner and the tribunal had, albeit with more material being relied on.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">43.	Ultimately the analysis concluded that while &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">there is a strong possibility that [the applicant] would be sent to prison if returned to [Country X]&#8221; &#8230; the evidence put forward does not have sufficient weight to establish that [the applicant] is at risk of torture and inhumane treatment or execution if returned to Country X&#8221;.</font></i>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">44.	On 16th October, 2016, at approximately 7.20 am the applicant was arrested at Dublin Airport while attempting to board flight no. FR4518 bound for Athens. He was using a false Belgian identity document bearing his photograph and the name of a Mr. M.A. His travel documentation had been fraudulently obtained on the basis of that identity.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">45.	He was brought to Ballymun Garda Station and charged with an offence under s. 29 of the Criminal Justice Theft and Fraud Offences Act 2001. He was remanded in custody to appear at Cloverhill District Court on 21st October, 2016. He was found in possession of &#8364;2,665 and �75 sterling at the time of his arrest.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">46.	The applicant in due course pleaded guilty and was remanded for sentence on 5th January, 2017. He was subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 months, which he is serving as of the date of this judgment. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Procedural issues subsequent to commencement of the proceedings</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">47.	By the time the leave application was moved in this case, the applicant was already in custody. That added a certain additional degree of urgency to the proceedings. It was agreed between the parties that the leave application should be telescoped and I so ordered. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">48.	On 7th November, 2016, I gave Mr. Remy Farrell S.C. (with Ms. Sinead McGrath B.L.), who appeared for the respondent, leave to file a further affidavit setting out the full text of the country material which was before the Minister, albeit that, in the analysis, such material was referred to by hyperlink rather than by annexing the full text. In general terms, hyperlinking as opposed to verbatim quotation does not change the character of the documents as material before the decision-maker. All such material, or any relevant information, should be put before the court by the respondent (unless exceptionally confidential): </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Neill v. Governor of Castlerea Prison </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2004] 1 I.R. 298. As it is helpfully put at p. 125 of Fordham&#8217;s Judicial Review Handbook (6th ed.) (Oxford, Hart, 2012), cited with approval in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R. (Bancoult) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2)</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] UKSC 35 per Lord Clarke (diss.), at para. 182 (and see per Lady Hale (diss.), at para. 193): &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">A defendant public authority and its lawyers owe a vital duty to make full and fair disclosure of relevant material</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#8221; The full text of the material that was considered by the Minister in this case is such relevant material. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">49.	Mr. Lynn submitted that only the extracts quoted verbatim in the analysis were before the Minister; but the decision itself says otherwise. He also suggests that more senior officials did not access this material; but there is no evidence in favour of that proposition, and even if that were the case, the material was still considered by a responsible agent of the Minister. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">50.	On 14th November, 2016, the applicant raised the question of a possible amendment of the proceedings relating to the need to consider certain materials which were not in fact included in the s. 3 submission made on his behalf to the Minister prior to the deportation order. The option of making a s. 3(11) application instead was canvassed on that occasion. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">51.	Mr. Lynn also indicated at that time that the applicant was not pursuing any suggested amendment regarding declaratory relief in relation to an entitlement to an automatic stay (an issue which he had previously flagged), in the light of objections from the respondent that the question was hypothetical and that the applicant did not have standing because he had the benefit of an actual stay. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">52.	The applicant did however wish to avail of the option to apply for revocation of the deportation order and I adjourned the matter to allow the applicant to make a s. 3(11) application and to allow time for the Minister to reply and for any consequential amendment (if required) to be formulated. A s. 3(11) application was made on 22nd November, 2016. That application was considered and refused by the Minister on 6th December, 2016. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">53.	The refusal decision notes that para. 10 of the application stated that consequent on the French investigation and conviction, one of the applicant&#8217;s brothers, G.Y., was sentenced to 5 years&#8217; imprisonment in relation to a forgery charge and not in relation to terrorism, and the case against the other brother, C.Y., was dismissed. It went on to allege that when G.Y. was returned to Country X he was detained for 2 or 3 days and interrogated, and was released &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">because he was not convicted or suspected of being involved in terrorist activity</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; by the Country X authorities. This was in the context where the French conviction was said to be non-terrorist. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">54.	However, contrary to the applicant&#8217;s representations, the refusal decision noted that the minutes of the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris pronounced G.Y. guilty of involvement in a criminal organisation preparing an act of terrorism, &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">terrorism: fraudulent possession of several false administrative documents</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; and &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">terrorism: falsification of an administrative document establishing a right, an identity or a quality</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, and illegal entry or stay of a foreigner in France.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">55.	The refusal decision went on to state that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">despite having convictions for terrorist offences his brother was detained only for three days and now enjoys an &#8220;ok&#8221; life in [Country X]. This misrepresentation calls into question the candour of the applicant</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">56.	The refusal decision also went on to state that the case against the other brother C.Y. was not dismissed and that he was found guilty of terrorist-related offences and sentenced to 3 years&#8217; imprisonment, suspended for 2 years on certain conditions. </font>

The applicant is entitled to an effective remedy in respect of his claim under art. 3 of the ECHR, by virtue of art. 13 of that instrument: see e.g., para. 76 of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H.R. v.

The right to an effective remedy is also recognised by art. 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and art. 2 of the ICCPR. Such a remedy includes a right to suspension of the transfer pending such examination: </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 36378/02, European Court of Human Rights, 12th April 2005), para. 448, and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.S.S. v.

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">62.	For many reasons, of which I will mention one, the Constitution of Ireland should generally be construed where possible as affording rights (and requiring obligations) no less extensive than those in international law. The primary jurisprudential basis for that approach is that our Constitution recognises, rather than creates, rights, and thus enshrines a theory of the natural rights of the individual. By definition, that cannot be viewed as a peculiarly national phenomenon; natural rights must be universal rights. Thus, guidance as to the scope and content of such constitutional rights can legitimately be derived from widely-agreed conceptions of rights and duties as recognised at the regional and international level and in individual foreign jurisdictions as appropriate. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">63.	The philosophy of natural rights has been re-emphasised as recently as 2015 by the enactment of the 31st Amendment inserting Article 42A.1 and 2.1� which expressly acknowledge the natural rights of children. Such natural rights of children are only one example of the natural rights of all human persons recognised by the Constitution, and indeed given the continuity of the human lifecycle, natural rights one enjoys as a child can hardly be taken to disappear on and after one&#8217;s eighteenth birthday. As Mr. Justice Costello put it in &#8220;The Irish Judge as Law-Maker&#8221; in Curtin and O&#8217;Keeffe (Eds.), </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Constitutional Adjudication in European Community and National Law: Essays for the Hon. Mr. Justice T.F. O&#8217;Higgins</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Butterworths, 2002) 159, at p. 161, &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">A judge may be a legal positivist and have no use for natural law concepts, but if the Constitution (as it does) explicitly recognises the existence of rights anterior to positive law these jurisprudential views must yield to the clear conclusions which are to be drawn from the construction of the constitutional text</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#8221; That being the case, and given that the Constitution clearly acknowledges that rights pre-exist law, are therefore by definition, natural, and by inescapable consequence, universal, it is necessary and appropriate for Irish courts to draw on supranational and international materials in order to derive assistance as to the scope and content of such natural rights, whether enumerated or unenumerated. The same considerations apply to those inseparable although less celebrated companions of fundamental rights, fundamental duties. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">64.	In the light of such considerations it seems to me that that the right to an effective remedy, involving independent review of a legally cognisable complaint, should be recognised as an unenumerated right under Article 40.3 of the Constitution. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">65.	The independent review required by the right to an effective remedy, in the present context, must come in the form of judicial review, which in the contemporary context involves a potentially searching examination of the reasonableness, proportionality and legality of the ministerial decision. An effective remedy does not however require the reviewer to substitute his or her own view for that of the decision-maker. In the judicial review context, it is the decision being reviewed that remains in issue, and therefore in broad terms that decision must be judged by reference to the materials before its maker. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">66.	But can subsequent or other materials be looked at in order to assess the reasonableness or proportionality of the decision? Mr. Lynn submitted at one stage (although he later decided not to pursue the submission) that this should exceptionally be so in order to give effect to art. 3, relying on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">N. v. Finland</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 3885/02, European Court of Human Rights, 30th November, 2005) (2006) 43 E.H.R.R. 12. On the other hand, Feeney J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Izevbekhai v. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2008] IEHC 23 (Unreported, High Court, 30th January, 2008) and Hogan J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Efe v. Minister for Justice and Equality</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2011] IEHC 214, held that the appropriate remedy was a s. 3(11) application rather than putting new material before the court. In that regard, there is the general difficulty that s. 3(11) broadly relates to a change of circumstances (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Smith v. Minister for Justice and Equality</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2013] IESC 4 (Unreported, Supreme Court, Clarke J. (Denham C.J. and McKechnie J. concurring), 1st February, 2013). Given that the submission was abandoned, I do not need to consider it further. The s. 3(11) revocation option was chosen in this case and I am now considering challenges both to the original decision and as affirmed.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The challenge to the deportation order</font></b>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The applicant&#8217;s main point</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">67.	The applicant&#8217;s primary submission was that the Minister was bound by the view of the tribunal that the applicant would suffer serious harm if returned to Country X. The jurisprudential ground for this proposition was put on three alternative bases:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	that the deportation decision was subject to EU law, which required such decisions to be made by the tribunal;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	that general rule of law considerations compelled such a conclusion, because otherwise the Minister&#8217;s decision would be based on &#8220;happenstance&#8221; and would be arbitrary; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	that art. 3 of the ECHR requires independent review of the assessment of the claim, which cannot be achieved unless the Minister is bound by the tribunal. </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">68.	I will consider each of these propositions in turn. </font>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Is the deportation decision subject to EU law?</font></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">69.	Mr. Lynn submits that the deportation decision is subject to EU law because article 21(1) of the EU qualification directive (Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April, 2004, on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted) prohibits refoulement. However this argument is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the scope of the directive. Article 2(a) of the directive defines international protection as confined to refugee and subsidiary protection processes. As I pointed out in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">S.A. v. Minister for Justice and Equality </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2016] IEHC 462 (Unreported, High Court, 29th July, 2016) at para. 27, art. 21 of the directive only applies to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">refoulement</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of recognised refugees. That conclusion is supported by Hemme Batjes, &#8220;Asylum Qualification Directive 2011/95/EU (Articles 20-42)&#8221;, in Part DIII of Hailbronner and Thym, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">EU Immigration and Asylum Law</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (2nd Ed.), (M�nchen, C.H. Beck, 2016), at p. 1257. In addition it is clear from the fact that the returns directive (Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals) deals with </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">refoulement</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of unsuccessful applicants for asylum, and that the procedures directive (Council Directive 2005/85/EC of 1 December 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status) deals with </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">refoulement</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of applicants pending a decision, that the strictures of art. 21 of the qualification directive apply only to recognised refugees. A significant part of the reason for the Irish opt-out from the returns directive was to preserve the domestic sovereignty over treatment of failed asylum seekers and others in a similar category. That approach would be set at nought by the proposed unwarranted interpretation of the directive urged by Mr. Lynn.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">70.	The somewhat tortured argument made under this heading is founded on a laboriously literal reading of one part only of art. 21. Reading the article as a whole, and reading the directives together, it is clear that art. 21 applies only to the return of recognised refugees and not to &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">all protection seekers</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; as incorrectly contended in oral argument. Obviously, breaking fragments off any text and reading them in isolation can produce arbitrarily incorrect meanings; that is why reading in context is perhaps the first rule of interpretation. It is even a logical prerequisite to the paramount rule of reading in accordance with the document&#8217;s purpose, because the purpose can only be determined from the overall context. No rational legal system can permit parties to cherry-pick which portions of an overall text should be wrenched out of context in order to shape a result. Any coherent reading of the directive as a whole, and of the sequence of EU immigration and asylum directives taken together, makes clear that the point is meritless and bordering on unstateable. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">71.	Reliance was placed on the opinion of Advocate-General Sharpton of 31st May, 2016, in Case C-573/14, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Commissaire g�n�ral aux r�fugi�s et aux apatrides v. Lounani</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, a case concerning an alleged terrorist asylum-seeker, in which it was noted that the exclusion clause has an effect &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">to deprive an applicant of the protection of refugee status</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (para. 33) and not necessarily to imply that he or she may be returned (para. 21, citing art. 4 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, art. 3 of the ECHR, and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chahal v. United Kingdom</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Application no. 22414/93, 15th November, 1996 ). This is unexceptional and does not in any way suggest that art. 21 has any relevance to persons who are not refugees. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">72.	Mr. Lynn in oral submissions suggested that the Minister was bound by the decision of the tribunal that the application was at risk of serious harm, submitting that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the whole procedure is an EU law one and for that reason we have a cast-iron case because the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is the body entrusted by the EU to determine subsidiary protection</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. However that proposition is fundamentally misconceived because the whole procedure is not an EU law one. The process passes over to domestic law as soon as the international protection decision has been made adversely to an applicant.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">73.	Mr. Lynn also submits that national legislation, in the form of regulations (a type of instrument that of course has &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">a definite legislative character</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; Hogan and Morgan, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Administrative Law in Ireland</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (4th ed.) (Dublin, Thompson Round Hall, 2010), p. 47, para. 2-104), should be interpreted in a manner that requires the Minister to follow the view of the tribunal. However the national legislation in question is designed to implement EU law and therefore should be interpreted in harmony with it rather than in a manner that creates some restriction on the Minister&#8217;s powers unknown to EU law. If (as is the case) EU law does not require the Minister to make her deportation decisions in accordance with obiter views that might be expressed by the tribunal when rejecting an application for subsidiary protection, then there is simply no basis to construe national regulations designed to implement EU law in a way that would produce a result which EU law does not require. That this is the effect of the applicant&#8217;s submission only goes to show the convoluted and essentially misconceived nature of what is being argued. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">74.	Mr. Lynn submits that subsidiary protection is in some circumstances an absolute protection, relying on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">N.A. v. U.K.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application No. 25904/07), 17th July 2008, paras. 115-117, as cited in Case C-465/07 </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Elgafaji v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Court of Justice of the EU, 17th February, 2009) [2009] 1 W.L.R. 2100 at para. 44. N.A., however, only stated that art. 3 of the ECHR would be engaged &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">in the most extreme cases of general violence</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (para. 115); thus implying that other cases where subsidiary protection applies would not be covered by the absolute bar on return under art. 3. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">75.	Reliance is placed on the proposition that it is an inescapable obligation of the qualification directive that functions be vested in an identified agency, in this case the tribunal (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">B.A. v. Minister for Justice and Equality</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2014] 2 I.R. 377, p. 392). But that has been done. The tribunal has carried out its function by rejecting the application for subsidiary protection. The statute does not give life to its obiter statements or secondary findings by making them binding on the Minister. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">76.	While in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O.S. v. Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2011] 4 I.R. 595 the discretion to grant asylum despite rejection of a claim by the tribunal was discussed, and the action by the tribunal and Minister were described as part of a &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">single administrative adjudication</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (p. 602), this does not arise in subsidiary protection where the tribunal&#8217;s decision is itself binding. Mr. Lynn extrapolates from this fragment of the language used in that case a supposed principle that the decision of the tribunal as to the level of risk must also be binding. That conclusion does not follow and would re-write the statute. The tribunal&#8217;s decision was to reject the claim and that decision was indeed followed by the Minister. The precise reasoning is not binding in any sense that is apparent from the statutory provisions. Again, judgments are not statutes and must not be read as such. Comments in judgments must be read in context and are not a basis to warp actual statutory language which did not arise and was not considered in such judgments. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">77.	Mr. Lynn submits that if the country situation changed between a tribunal decision of the kind at issue here and a ministerial decision then it could be revisited, but no such change has been appropriately demonstrated. That submission seems fundamentally inconsistent with the idea (the applicant&#8217;s primary submission) that the tribunal&#8217;s conclusions on particular issues (as opposed to its final decision) is binding per se. But the statute does not limit the Minister&#8217;s power to herself assess whether to deport by reference to the question of whether the situation has so changed. In any event, for what it is worth, it is clear that the situation in Country X has been continuously evolving, a matter to which I will return.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">78.	Mr. Lynn submits that art. 4(3)(c) of the qualification directive requires the protection decision-maker to take into account the internal situation in the country concerned and suggests that this implies that a consideration and assessment of country of origin material is necessary in every case. This is an argument that I have already considered and rejected in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">G.I. v. Minister for Justice and Equality</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] IEHC 682 (Unreported, High Court, 6th November, 2015) (see paras. 19 to 26). As it has recently been put, &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is now a considerable body of case-law that stands as authority for the proposition that, because asylum claims require a number of essential elements to be established, it is unnecessary to require a decision-maker to decide on every such element where an adverse finding has been made in respect of one, save in exceptional circumstances of no relevance here</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;: per Keane J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">N.N. v. Minister for Justice and Equality</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2017] IEHC 99 (at para. 48), citing, inter alia, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">E.K.K. v. Minister for Justice and Equality</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IEHC 38 (at para. 52). </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">79.	In this case, all material was considered including country of origin material. Neither national nor EU law require narrative discussion or findings on country material if there is a separate ground to determine the matter. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">G.I</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">., the separate ground was credibility. In this case, it was the exclusion clause. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">80.	I therefore uphold para. 6 of the Statement of Opposition, which correctly asserts that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">at the time of the examination of his representations under section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the Applicant was no longer an applicant for refugee status under the terms of the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and / or an applicant for subsidiary protection under the terms of S.I. 426 of 2013 / Directive 2004/83/EC. In the premises, it is pleaded that the application was not governed by EU law and, specifically, it was outside the scope of Directive 2004/83/EC.&#8221; It follows that para. 8 of the statement of opposition is also correct to assert that &#8220;the allegation of the application of S.I. 426 of 2013 and Directive 2004/83/EC to the Respondent when considering the representations under section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) is fundamentally misconceived</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#8221;</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Is it arbitrary to acknowledge that the Minister can determine refoulement issues in a manner contrary to the tribunal&#8217;s approach?</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">81.	Mr. Lynn submits that it is only the &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">happenstance</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, as he calls it, of a determination by the tribunal that the exclusion clause applies. That finding means, on the respondent&#8217;s case, that the Minister feels free to depart from a tribunal finding that would otherwise be binding (by virtue of reg. 20(1)(b) of the EU (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2016). This result, he submits, is arbitrary.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">82.	But it is not arbitrary. Nor is the application of the exclusion clause some sort of external accidental happenstance which has nothing to do with the applicant. The application of the exclusion clause in effect transfers the final decision on serious harm from the tribunal to the Minister, and renders the tribunal&#8217;s views on harm or any other issue essentially </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">obiter</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. At the deportation order stage, the Minister is not obliged to follow any findings made in the course of the protection claim such as regarding the applicant&#8217;s account, or even as to harm, internal relocation or state protection, if the application is ultimately rejected, because it is the outcome of the protection process that binds, not views expressed along the way. To hold otherwise would be to give the tribunal decision an ongoing status not warranted by the statutory scheme. It is the final outcome of the tribunal (in this case, rejection of the applicant&#8217;s claim) that is binding on the Minister, not necessarily the reasoning process by which it got to that point. I might observe that in the present case, as it happens, the tribunal&#8217;s reasoning process on the harm issue is far from evident given that the applicant&#8217;s submissions on the detail of this issue were pretty much rejected. The reasoning of the tribunal on this point seems to me to be largely if not entirely absent and certainly to fall short of the sort of clear standard mandated by the Supreme Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Meadows v. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2010] 2 I.R. 701. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">83.	The argument that the process is seamless and that the tribunal decision is </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">res judicata</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is lacking in merit. As it happens, that argument was not made when the applicant made submissions under s. 3 of the 1999 Act originally. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">84.	Ultimately the applicant&#8217;s argument under this heading is a sort of legal version of &#8220;if &#8216;ifs&#8217; and &#8216;ands&#8217; were pots and pans&#8221;. Yes, if his conduct had not triggered the exclusion clause, things would be different. But it did, and the present case cannot be judged in accordance with the fantasy landscape of a parallel alternative legal universe. </font><br>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">86.	It is clear that the applicant is entitled to &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">independent scrutiny</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; of the claim that there are substantial grounds for hearing a real risk of treatment contrary to art. 3 (Chahal, para. 151). However that decision must be read in the context that some scrutiny can be provided either by an independent administrative body or by the courts.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">87.	A conclusion that the ultimate decision falls to the Minister, subject to judicial review, rather than the tribunal, does not dilute the independence of the tribunal in relation to the matters which it can decide (reg. 28(1) of the 2016 regulations). </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">88.	The European Court of Human Rights had held in Soering at paras. 121 to 124, that judicial review was an effective remedy for the purposes of art. 3 for the purposes of the matters considered in that judgment. That approach was reaffirmed in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Vilvarajah v. United Kingdom</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Application nos. 13163/87, 13164/87, 13165/87, 13447/87</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">13448/87</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, European Court of Human Rights, 30th October, 1991), at paras. 122 to 127.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">89.	However in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chahal</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, while reaffirming the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Vilvarajah</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> jurisprudence, the court, at paras. 148 to 153, noted that United Kingdom judicial review was not an effective remedy in circumstances where the courts of that country could not assess the art. 3 risk independently of questions of national security. In coming to that view, it is clear that the court has taken the United Kingdom&#8217;s legal approach as being that only a minimal level of judicial scrutiny was involved in national security cases, citing </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Council of Civil Services Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[1985] A.C. 374, at p. 402, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Cheblak</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1991] 2 All E.R. 319. Such an approach has not been the Irish law; quite the reverse. The courts here are not inhibited from reviewing ministerial deportation decisions because security considerations are alleged to be involved. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">90.	Further, the Court of Appeal in the recent decision of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">N.M. (D.R.C.) v. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IECA 217 [2016] 2 I.L.R.M. 369 held (per Hogan J.) that the wide scope of contemporary judicial review &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">does indeed provide an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 39</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; of the Asylum procedures directive (Directive 2005/85/EC) (para. 59).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">91.	Overall, the respondents are correct to plead as they do at para. 10 of the statement of opposition, that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the examination of the Respondent carried out on the 7th September 2016, the subsequent signing of the Deportation Order, was a process which was independent of the asylum and international protection process. It is pleaded that the Applicant has sought to erroneously conflate the section 3 process with the international protection process. The Respondent had access to the entirety of the Applicant&#8217;s files and analysed further country of origin information in the light of the separate and distinct duty of the Respondent to consider non refoulement under section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended)</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#8221; I also uphold the contention at para. 11 of the statement of opposition that &#8220;the Respondent was not bound / constrained and /or limited in that decision and / or analysis by matters stated by the bodies designated by statute to analyse the asylum and subsidiary protection applications&#8221;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">92.	The Minister&#8217;s failure to follow the view of the tribunal is not unlawful and does not infringe any constitutional, EU or ECHR rights of the applicant. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">93.	As the main complaint fails I turn now to what the applicant refers to as his subsidiary grounds of challenge. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Is it a breach of fair procedures to revisit the finding of the tribunal when this was not signalled to the applicant?</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">94.	The applicant relies on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">P.S. v. Refugee Appeals Tribunal</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2010] IEHC 177 (Unreported, High Court, Cooke J., 11th May, 2010) and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Victoria Idiakheua v. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2005] IEHC 150 (Unreported, High Court, Clarke J., 10th May, 2005) in support of the conception that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">a reasonable opportunity to know the matters which may be likely to affect the judgment of [the decision-making] body</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; should be afforded (per Clarke J.), as should notice of matters that would come as a surprise (per Cooke J., at para. 29). Those views were of course in the context of the asylum system, but even apart from that, the fact that an applicant is surprised (in this case, by the reversal of a finding of the tribunal) does not of itself mean that fair procedures have been undermined. To go down that jurisprudential rabbit-hole would be to put a premium on a failure or unwillingness by lawyers for applicants to anticipate reasonably foreseeable outcomes. It would create a perverse incentive for failure to engage with the process. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">95.	The applicant was put on notice of possible deportation by the s. 3 notice. That constitutes sufficient notice that any argument against deportation (e.g., that the Minister should be bound by the tribunal) should be put forward. Further spoon-feeding of the applicant&#8217;s representatives is not required. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">96.	Wide obiter statements must be read in their context and as subject to development in subsequent cases under different factual situations. Notice is not literally required of anything that could be a surprise or that could affect the decision-maker. There is no logical (or therefore legal) reason to be required to give notice of something that an applicant is actually aware of, or must be taken to be aware of. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">97.	I thus agree with the contention at para. 21 of the statement of opposition that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the Applicant was fully on notice of this issue in the section 3 process and addressed the same in the representations made to the Respondent</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Is it a breach of fair procedures to rely on country material not signalled to the applicant? </font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">98.	The answer to this question depends on the nature of the material rather than just on whether it is going to be relied on. Widely-known and standard material such as reports of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, the U.S. State Department or the U.K. Border Agency do not need to be notified. Any applicant must be taken to have access at all times to general published country information of this kind, and must be taken to be aware that such general material is the background against which protection claims will be assessed. Obscure material that is going to materially change the picture appearing from the basic and universal material should however be notified. Mr. Lynn plaintively asks in relation to generally available country reports, &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">is the solicitor in a pre-emptive move expected to go through all those reports?</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; Unfortunately, he is. It seems odd that over 20 years on from the enactment of a statutory protection system, the need to read generally-available country reports as a matter of course could come as a surprise ; or in particular that solicitors holding themselves out as acting in the immigration and asylum area should pleadingly seek exemption from the plight of having to look up such material. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">99.	I therefore uphold the plea at para. 24 of the statement of opposition that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">requirements of constitutional and/or natural justice and/or the law on fair procedures do not require notice to be given to the Applicant of well-known, objective and publicly accessible country of origin information, including country reports from the United States State Department, or country information from the United Kingdom Home Office. Specifically, it is pleaded that no obligation arose in the circumstances of the case to canvass the views of the Applicant in respect of same</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Was the decision to favour certain country information over that preferred by the applicant lacking in reasons?</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">100.	Overall the challenge to the analysis of art. 3 risk in the original order has been superseded by the fresh and more up-to-date consideration of those issues in the s. 3(11) context. Even if there was some non-consideration of material not put forward originally by the applicant, that was cured by the s. 3(11) review. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">101.	Mr. Lynn submits that the decision of Edwards J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">D.V.T.S. v. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2008] 3 I.R. 476 precludes the Minister rejecting favourable country of origin information and following other such information without giving some explanation (para. 44). But there is an explanation: the Minister is relying on more recent information and in particular on the specific elements of the new information quoted in the decision. Admittedly the Minister does not specifically use a laborious formula such as: &#8220;I favour this information over the applicant&#8217;s preferred information because it is more recent&#8221;; but one cannot be over-prescriptive about how decisions are phrased. That rationale is quite clear when one considers both the annual nature of country information and the circumstances of this case. Again, it is not for an applicant or indeed the court to dictate the format and wording of administrative decisions. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Was the decision unreasonable, given the evidence regarding incommunicado detention in the country concerned?</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">102.	The applicant relies on a range of country material submitted to the Minister regarding detention by the security services in Country X, in particular the following:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	Amnesty annual reports, 2011 and 2012;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	Refugee Documentation Centre Legal Aid Board report of 2nd April, 2009 referring to a case in June, 2006;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada material referring to a case in January, 2007;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv).	Freedom in the World report 2014 for Country X, published by Freedom House;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v).	Human Rights Watch World reports, 2012 and 2015; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi).	State Department Country X Human Rights Report 2011.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">103.	Much of the country of origin&#8217;s material is supportive of the proposition that there is a real risk that terrorist suspects (and in some cases convicted prisoners) are held for periods in possibly secret detention centres and incommunicado; a lack of facilitation of visits from Amnesty, the UN </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">rapporteur</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on torture or the UN working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances; and a lack of implementation of UN Committee against Torture recommendations on the death of a detainee in December, 2006. On the basis of this material Mr. Lynn says in oral submissions that the country &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">does not have any respect whatsoever for the rule of law&#8221; </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">and that this</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#8220;must be one of the most disquieting countries that exist</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">104.	The original s. 3 submissions of 22nd April, 2016 referred to two cases of persons held incommunicado and reportedly tortured in February, 2015 and September, 2015. However the Minister did consider the submission even if it was not narratively discussed. There is generally no obligation to engage in narrative discussion of all of an applicant&#8217;s material, save in limited circumstances: see per Keane J. in N.N., at para. 49, citing </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">I.E. v. Minister for Justice and Equality</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IEHC 85 (at para. 40) and per Hardiman J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">G.K. v. Minister for Justice</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2002] 2 I.R. 418 (at pp. 426-427). </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">105.	The material referring to two cases of ill-treatment in 2015 is not such that it renders unlawful the Minister&#8217;s conclusion that this particular applicant is not at substantial risk. Such material (and other public-domain material related to Country X, such as for example that listed in the annex to this judgment, or other judgments and decisions such as the Views adopted by the UN Human Rights Committee in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mejdoub Chani</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, Application no. 2297/2013, 11th March, 2016) may support the contention that particular individuals were treated inhumanely at particular times, but such a conclusion cannot be generalised in the manner sought by the applicant unharnessed from the country material generally. The failure to refer expressly to this material has to be read in the light of the fact that the Minister acknowledges human rights shortcomings in Country X. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">106.	The detention practices of Country X are of crucial importance because the European Court of Human Rights has over time expanded the boundaries of the protections of art. 3. On a literal reading of the provision as adopted, art. 3 precludes the contracting party itself from engaging in inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or torture. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chahal</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the provision was extended to preclude the removal of a person to a territory where there are substantial grounds for believing in a real risk of such treatment or punishment, as opposed to a probability. An attempt by the U.K. government to argue for a higher level of probability, at least in terror cases, was knocked back in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saadi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, paras. 124 to 133. A further expansion of the provision has arisen from </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daoudi v. France</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 19576/08, European Court of Human Rights, 3rd December, 2009), an important case for present purposes, to the effect that, if the country has a practice of incommunicado detention, there may be inadequate safeguards to guarantee that the person will not be subject to such treatment or punishment, and that therefore art. 3 precludes removal to such a country. At one level that is quite an expansion of the (absolute) provisions of art. 3 in that it extrapolates a conclusion as to risk of torture from a mere absence of information as to detention practices. However I say that not by way of criticism of Strasbourg but by way of emphasis that, where absolute provisions (not susceptible to normal checks and balances) are at issue, considerable care must be taken before concluding that a violation arises.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">107.	In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daoudi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the court reviewed a great deal of country of origin material in relation to Country X, in particular the following:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	Amnesty International reports in 2006 on torture by the military security in Country X;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	Annual reports from Amnesty in 2007 and 2008;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	Communique from Amnesty regarding the release of a prisoner in 2008;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv).	2008 communication from Amnesty to the UN Human Rights Committee;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v).	Human Rights Watch report on detention in Country X, 2007;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi).	Human Rights Watch report on U.K. Diplomatic assurances, 2008;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vii).	Country summary published by Human Rights Watch in January 2009;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(viii).	UN Human Rights Committee report 2007;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ix).	UN Committee on Torture final observations of 2008 on Country X;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(x).	Report to the Human Rights Council of the UN by special rapporteur 2009;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(xi).	State Department country report on human rights practices 2007 and 2008 (published January 2009);</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(xii).	Country of Origin Information Report (Country X) published by the U.K. Home Office 2008; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(xiii).	Judgments of the U.K. Asylum and Immigration Tribunal: </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H.S. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2008] UKAIT 00048 (19th May, 2008); </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">A.F. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2009] UKAIT 00023 (22nd June, 2009).</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">108.	On the basis of that material, the court was of the view in the context of that particular applicant (who had a French, but not a Country X, conviction) that there were substantial grounds for believing that the applicant would be subjected to treatment contrary to art. 3. That arose from an intersection between his personal circumstances and the general situation in the country. The personal circumstances included:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	the applicant&#8217;s terrorist conviction in France of which Country X was aware;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	the applicant being suspected of links with terrorism by Country X; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	the fact that an amnesty that occurred in the country in 2005 did not apply to the applicant. </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">109.	The features of the country situation that were important to the court were:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	the fact that persons suspected of terror involvement were arrested and detained in unforeseeable circumstances and without clearly established legal grounds for the purpose of being interrogated;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	the absence of adequate judicial safeguards;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	secret detentions lasting up to several months;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv).	the impossibility of monitoring developments in the country;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v).	the absence of a control system to ensure that detainees would not be tortured in secret detention centres;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi).	the inability of such prisoners to submit complaints to the domestic or international courts.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">110.	The </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daoudi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> decision was subsequently considered in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H.R. v. France</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. In that decision the court considered further country of origin information including:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	Country summary published by Human Rights Watch in January, 2010;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	U.K. Home Office Country of Origin Information Report, March, 2010;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	Annual Report of Amnesty International, 2010; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv).	2009 country report on human rights practices, published by US State Department March, 2010.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">111.	 The court recalled the principles of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saadi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daoudi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. It was noted that the government of Country X had ended the state of emergency but, nonetheless, based on the country material, it was concluded that the human rights situation had changed little (&#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">peu �volu�</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;) (para. 51) between the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daoudi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in December, 2009 and the lifting of the state of emergency in February, 2011. The situation thereafter continued to pose a real risk for the applicant (who had a Country X terror conviction) because; </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	the court did not have specific information as to the situation in view of the fact that the state of emergency had been lifted only recently (para. 62); </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	information provided by the French government from lawyers of the country was too imprecise (para. 61); and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	a press release from the Council of Ministers of Country X suggested that the lifting of the state of emergency did not amount to a change in the situation but to a continuation of the struggle to put an end to terrorism (para. 62).</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">112.	Two recent admissibility decisions were also opened to me, although they are not directly in point. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">113.	</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">In M.K. v. France</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 76100/13, European Court of Human Rights, 24th September, 2015), the court recalled its decisions in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saadi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 30696/09, European Court of Human Rights, 21st January, 2011). It noted that national decision-makers were normally better placed to evaluate the evidence before them (citing </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Klaas v. Germany</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 15473/89, European Court of Human Rights, 22 September, 1993), para. 29 Series A no 269). In that case, it was held that internal relocation was an available option to address a threat emanating from non-governmental persons. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">114.	</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.X. v. France</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 21580/10, European Court of Human Rights, 1st July, 2014) was also cited, but also appears to turn on a ground that does not arise here. </font>

Secretary of State for the Home Department</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, SC/38/2005, Special Immigration Appeals Commission (26th March, 2010), at paras. 52 to 64, the commission considered the fate of a series of persons with suspected terror links who had actually been returned between 2007 and 2010, some with diplomatic guarantees and some without. Generally no art. 3 breaches were established. At paras. 65 to 73 the commission set out reasons why an external verification system for assurances was not a legal requirement (see also decision of the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">House of Lords in R.B. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, [2009] UKHL 10, per Lord Hoffman, para. 193); and held that assurances were capable of being verified by other means. For example, detainees were spoken to by Amnesty International, lawyers and relatives after release and offered the opportunity to speak to British officials. </font>

Secretary of State for the Home Department</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] UKSIAC SC/39/2005 (18th April, 2016) the existing systems of verification (protest by families, lawyers, official scrutiny, press, international attention, NGOs and the British Embassy (para. 75)) were held to be insufficiently robust. Para. 119 notes that after the case had been argued, the Country X Security Service, which had loomed large in previous country of origin material, was &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">disbanded</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. That was held to be an insufficient basis to hold that the risk to the applicants had been resolved (para. 121). Improvements in the country situation were not such as to obviate the need for &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">effective verification</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; of diplomatic assurances given. Thus deportation, even with diplomatic assurances, of a person likely to come to security service attention, would be unlawful. Such an approach is pitching the level of judicial second-guessing of the executive at a very high level indeed: in my view, at a level that is far too high to be compatible with the principle of separation of powers. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">117.	One then has to ask how the decision of the Minister in the present case measures up against the analysis of the Strasbourg Court. The personal circumstances of the applicant here are, superficially, not unduly dissimilar from those of the applicants in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daoudi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H.R.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in particular, with the one very significant exception that the applicant&#8217;s brother, also a terrorist convict in France, is living openly in Country X and is apparently &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ok</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">118.	In relation to the general situation, the Minister had more up-to-date country of origin material than that referred to by the Strasbourg court. That information is capable of putting some of the features relied on by the Strasbourg court in a new light having regard to ongoing improvements in Country X.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">119.	To take one example of the ongoing changes in Country X, Mr. Lynn suggests that because the new human rights body is funded by the Country X Government (per the UK Border Agency) it cannot be an effective guarantor of rights. But that is policy commentary and not a basis on which the court could substitute its view for that of the Minister. It does not follow that because a body is funded by the State that it is not independent of the State. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">120.	Overall, the decision is within the range of decisions reasonably open to the Minister having regard to both the personal circumstances of this particular applicant, and the totality of the country material including the up-to-date material. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">121.	Ultimately therefore I would uphold the contention set out at para. 18 of the statement of opposition that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the Respondent carried out her section 3 and section 5 examinations having regard to the entirety of the applicant&#8217;s asylum and immigration history. The respondent had regard to the entirety of his file, including the findings of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. However, it is pleaded that the Respondent carried out an independent examination of up-to-date country of origin information and examined whether the applicant was in danger of suffering a real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in breach of art.3 of the European Convention on Human Rights or the European Convention on Human Rights Act, 2003 or s. 4 of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act, 2000 and/or a threat to his life or freedom in breach of s.5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 Act</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">122.	If I am incorrect about that, any infirmity in the art. 3 analysis at the deportation order stage has been cured by the further consideration of the issue at the s. 3(11) stage, which I will deal with further below. No injustice to the applicant could thereby arise in relation to such issues. Judicial review being a discretionary remedy, it would be an improvident exercise of such discretion, and a precious piece of legal purism detached from practical considerations, to quash an original decision in relation to any failure to consider a matter which has now been fully considered in the affirmation decision. As with points considered in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">K.A.S. v. Minister for Justice and Equality</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IEHC 657, such an approach would be strictly </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;[f]or aficionados of pointless formalism</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, to whom </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;[r]eal-world facts are irrelevant</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (per Alito J. (diss.) in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mathis v. U.S.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 579 US __ (2016) (slip op. p. 9)).</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Was an incorrect standard of proof applied? </font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">123.	Mr. Lynn suggests an incorrect standard of proof was applied and objects to the wording of the analysis on two grounds. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">124.	Firstly, it refers to a &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">possibility</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; that the applicant may not be imprisoned. But, the Minister is not saying that it is anything more than a possibility and the decision does not turn on that. The analysis is essentially saying that it may be the case that the applicant will not in fact be imprisoned if returned, but in any event that if he is, his treatment in prison will not be such as to constitute inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or torture. Such an alternative analysis does not have to determine as a matter of probability which of two eventualities would transpire if neither of them would infringe art. 3 of the ECHR. As the respondent correctly contends at para. 27 of the statement of opposition, &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the allegation &#8230; is highly selective and wholly fails to reflect the entirety of the extensive reasoning adopted by the Respondent in her examinatio</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">n&#8221;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">125.	Secondly, it is submitted that it is not expressly stated in the analysis that the test is less than a balance of probabilities. But this is to have the applicant dictate the form of the decision. The decision does not misstate the test and the respondent&#8217;s affidavit (unchallenged) confirms that the correct test was applied. On the materials before me I would uphold the contention at para. 28 of the statement of opposition that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the Respondent applied the correct test under both article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and section 4 of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Act 2000 when examining the Applicant&#8217;s representations under section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). Specifically, it is clear from the substance of the examination that she was satisfied that there were no substantial grounds, on the basis of the publically available material before her, that the Applicant was in danger of suffering a real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in breach of article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights or the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 or section 4 of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2000 and / or a threat to his life or freedom in breach of section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 Act</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">126.	Accordingly this ground also fails. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Grounds of challenge to the s. 3(11) decision</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">127.	The applicant&#8217;s grounds of challenge to the s. 3(11) decision are as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	the decision was wrongly treated as an ad misericordiam decision;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	the decision was wrongly arrived at on the basis of the incorrect premise that the standard was different to that of the tribunal;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	the Minister failed to properly consider the Strasbourg and U.K. caselaw put forward by the applicant; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv).	the Minister failed to clearly deal with the applicant&#8217;s evidence that Country X operated secret detention centres, and insofar as that matter was inferentially dealt with, the finding lacked a proper evidential basis and relatedly failed to explain why country material supporting the applicant was not operative;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v).	the decision appeared to apply a judicial review test at first instance;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi).	more generally, the decision failed to give adequate reasons or was unreasonable; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vii).	insofar as the decision suggests that there has been an improvement in Country X, the correct legal test has not been applied insofar as the Minister relied on improvements without determining the significance and durability of the changes in line with the cessation provisions of the qualification directive, which the applicant submits reflects the test under art. 3 of the ECHR.</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Preliminary objection &#8211; lack of candour</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">128.	The respondent submits that the applicant had displayed &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">an egregious lack of candour and mala fides</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (supplementary submissions para. 8) (see </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R.C. v. Refugee Applications Commissioner</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2010] IEHC 490 (asylum applicants knowingly provided commissioner with false and misleading information, amounting to a &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">conspiracy to deceive</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (per Clark J. at para. 28)). </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">129.	I will proceed on the assumption (without so deciding) that the applicant&#8217;s lack of candour, which has been clearly established, is not a bar to his prosecuting the present proceedings. However the Minister found that it was relevant to the assessment of his personal circumstances, a finding that appears clearly reasonable. Any factual claim made by this applicant has to be viewed with scepticism given his history of fraudulent applications and deceptive conduct. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Preliminary objection &#8211; abuse of process</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">130.	Mr. Farrell submits that the applicant &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">has unlawfully and/or as an abuse of process sought to submit an application for revocation of the deportation order in circumstances, and during the course of judicial review proceedings, where he has also sought an order of certiorari quashing the deportation order</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (supplemental submissions para. 4). Reliance is placed on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Odulana v. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, (Unreported, High Court, Clarke J., 25th June, 2009), para. 43, where criticism is made of &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">procedural gambling</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; by making a revocation application and &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">on receipt of an unfavourable decision</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, only then seeking to challenge the underlying order. However, that is not an analogy to the present case because the applicant had already challenged the deportation order before making a revocation application based on material that he had not previously relied on.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">131.	I do not think the applicant can be accused of any abuse of process in those circumstances, especially where I permitted the matter to be adjourned in order to allow the applicant make a s. 3(11) application. In any event, the respondent was aware of the procedure being adopted and only cried foul after the event. If there really was an abuse of process (which there was not), that point should have been made in advance. The &#8220;abuse&#8221; (for want of a better word) is rather on the respondent&#8217;s side in complaining a procedure after the event, having failed to so complain when it was put in motion. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Preliminary objection &#8211; failure to explain why the material was not proffered earlier</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">132.	Mr. Farrell submits that no explanation was offered as to why the material in the s. 3(11) application was not offered at the time of the s. 3 proposal. Mr. Lynn explained at the hearing that the ECHR material did not come to light because he searched originally on the Strasbourg website for the English name of Country X and only at a late stage did he think of searching for the French name, at which point the cases came to light. That seems to be a fair explanation in the context of this case, although it might be less convincing in a second case now that lawyers might be taken to be on notice of the need to search in both languages.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">133.	In any event, even if I am wrong about that, no explanation is really required here, in the sense that the absolute nature of art. 3 means that material relevant to that provision must still be considered even if not put forward the first time, as long as it gives rise to a real and substantial issue regarding a risk of ill-treatment.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The complaint that the matter was treated as ad misericordiam</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">134.	The decision refers at p. 15 to the decision of the Supreme Court (Hardiman J.) in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">F.P. v. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2002] 1 I.R. 164, at p. 172, in which it was held that a s. 3 decision &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was in the nature of an ad misericordiam application</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (underlined in the s. 3(11) decision). A further quotation at p. 173 refers to reconsideration of matters &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">at the respondent&#8217;s discretion</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">135.	It is not clear as to why the reference to the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ad misericordiam</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature of a s. 3 application is quoted and underlined, but the underlining is not terribly apposite to the present case as it could suggest the possibility that this principle has particular relevance to a determination of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">refoulement</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or art. 3 of the ECHR. Insofar as a s. 3 decision (including s. 3(11)) is a consideration of whether deportation of an individual is substantively unlawful (e.g., by reference to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">refoulement</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or arts. 3 or 8 of the ECHR), the Minister is not conducting an ad misericordiam process. This is clear from the judgment of Murray C.J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Meadows v. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2010] 2 I.R. 701, at p. 713 para. 21, and p. 726 at para. 66, where the distinction between </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">refoulement</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and humanitarian grounds (&#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">where the discretion of the [Minister] is much broader</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;) is emphasised. At the same time, any other points made by an applicant (including that an unchallenged or unsuccessfully challenged decision at an earlier stage of the process was procedurally rather than substantively defective, such as due to lack of notice, a wrong test, irrationality and so forth) are discretionary and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ad misericordiam</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. That is why I emphasise the distinction between substantive lawfulness (which is not discretionary) and procedural lawfulness (in relation to which objection must be taken at the appropriate time, failing which the Minister has no obligation to reconsider issues at a later stage).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">136.	It is not unlawful for the Minister to give effect to an unchallenged, or unsuccessfully challenged, decision even if some procedural argument is made at a later stage about its lawfulness. However, the Minister must at all times be satisfied that deportation does not breach the substantive rights of the individual. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">137.	I would be inclined to think that the references to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ad misericordiam</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and discretionary matters in the analysis here are probably boiler-plate language that is resorted to in any given s. 3(11) decision. Those references in the context of this particular application may have been inapposite, and perhaps sub-optimally drafted, but on a fair reading of the decision as a whole one could not take the view that the art. 3 points were in fact treated as merely </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ad misericordiam</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. Even if one would categorise the wording as having semantic shortcomings, those did not actually taint the consideration of the s. 3(11) application. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Complaint that there was an incorrect decision that the Minister was applying a different standard to the tribunal</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">138.	The decision under s. 3(11) replies to the submission that the Minister incorrectly departed from the tribunal&#8217;s finding of serious harm by stating that the Minister was not bound by the tribunal and that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Each decision relates to different matters and the standards applicable to each are different</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">139.	The reference to different matters is correct, as accepted by Mr. Lynn, because for example the exclusion clause is relevant to the tribunal decision whereas not so to the s. 3(11) decision. The reference to &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">different standards</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; is possibly ambiguous. In essence, the tribunal in considering a risk of serious harm (art. 2(e) of the qualification directive) and the Minister in considering a risk under art. 3 of the ECHR. They are both considering substantial grounds that the person would face a real risk of serious harm, in this case by way of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment (see Case C-465/07 </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Elgafaji v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, para. 28).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">140.	However this is, at most, a semantic issue. If different matters arise then different standards also arise. For example, insofar as the s. 3(11) decision considers ad misericordiam matters, then different standards do apply. Given the choice between an interpretation of &#8220;different standards&#8221; that is correct and one that is incorrect, the applicant, predictably, urges the latter. That is not a permissible approach where the former is a more natural and correct interpretation, and where that interpretation is available to the court.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">141.	In any event, the decision-maker gives a reason for taking a different view, namely that the Minister had more up to date material than the tribunal. If that is a good reason, which it is, the decision would stand even if the sentence about different standards were knocked out. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alleged error in purporting to apply a judicial review test </font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">142.	The decision is criticised for referring to the law on the judicial review test (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Baby O v. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2002] 2 I.R. 169 and X.X., at paras. 125, 127 and 134). Those references are essentially background material and not directly relevant. The Minister does not purport to rely on those decisions in framing the test being applied. The particular passage from </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">X.X.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> cited in the affirming decision was also cited with approval by Judge O&#8217;Leary in her concurring opinion in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">J.K. v. Sweden</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 59166/12, European Court of Human Rights, 23rd August 2016) at para. 6.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">143.	At one level the applicant&#8217;s argument assumes an absence of sophistication of thought on the part of the Minister. It seems to me that the references to the judicial review test were inserted not so much to specifically guide the decision-maker as to make clear to the court dealing with a hypothetical future judicial review that the Minister was cognisant of the overall legal framework in which her decision would be examined. I would prefer to interpret the decision, as the doctrine of separation of powers would require, in a manner consistent with law, rather than seek to artificially read into it some sort of fundamental misunderstanding on the part of the decision-maker.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">144.	Referring to the judicial review test does not misstate the test for the decision-maker or render the decision unlawful, or liable to be quashed on judicial review. It is not for the applicant to dictate the form of the decision, or for the court to impose either some standard of academic perfection or, still less, particular notions of style and content that might appeal to a given judge on a given day. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alleged failure to consider the Strasbourg and UK caselaw relied on</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">145.	The s. 3(11) application relied on the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daoudi v. France</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 19576/08, European Court of Human Rights, 3rd December, 2012), </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H.R. v. France</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 64780/09, European Court of Human Rights, 22nd September, 2011), and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.X. v. France</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 21580/10, European Court of Human Rights, 1st July, 2014). In addition, reliance was placed on some U.K. decisions, but the focus of the submission in relation to the U.K. decisions was in relation to diplomatic assurances, which do not arise here as the Minister was of the view that there were not substantial grounds to contend that there is a real risk of inhumane treatment.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">146.	In the s. 3(11) decision, the Minister referred to the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.X</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. decision, but without narrative discussion of the other two Strasbourg decisions, other than by way of noting that the applicant relied on them. The U.K. decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">B.B. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was referred to (at p. 15 of the decision) in the context of a view that difficulties with verification mechanisms and assurances would arise if there was a finding that there was a real risk, which was not the case here. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">147.	The analysis cites </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Smith v. Minister for Justice and Equality</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2013] IESC 4, (Unreported, Supreme Court (Clarke J.), 1st February, 2013) para. 5.6 and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">C.R.A. v.

However, at the same time, the Minister cannot do anything substantively unlawful (see </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sivsivadse v.

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">150.	In particular, it must be emphasised that the prohibition on torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is absolute.

One is that a proposed expellee should not be generally shut out on procedural grounds (such as failure to make the material available at an earlier stage) from making a case that the expulsion would violate art. 3.

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">151.	However, the contention that a revocation application only arises in very limited circumstances is not in fact the basis of the decision in this case, because the analysis goes on to say that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the additional information submitted has been given due consideration</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; and that it is not of sufficient weight to establish that there is a risk of breach of art. 3. Thus no particular weight was given to the complaint that the material could have been advanced earlier. Even if such weight had been given, that was not fatal because the Minister did actually consider the material. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alleged inadequate art. 3 assessment </font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">152.	The applicant criticises the decision in relation to art. 3 from a number of different and related standpoints:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	it is submitted that the decision fails to have regard to the issue of secret detention;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	it is suggested that the decision is lacking in reasons;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	it is suggested that there is no explanation for preferring certain material over other material supportive of the applicant; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv).	insofar as there are reasons, it is suggested that the decision is irrational.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">153.	While the applicant submits that the decision is materially wrong in fact, unreasonable and irrational, and in breach of the duty to give reasons because there is no cogent and adequate explanation as to why conflicting information is not accepted (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">D.V.T.S. v. Minister for Justice</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2008] 3 I.R. 476), it is really the existence of conflicting country information that is at the core of the applicant&#8217;s point. If the applicant had no such information, the Minister&#8217;s reliance on the State Department Report would not be materially wrong in fact, unreasonable or irrational. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The situation up to September 2011 - ECHR decisions </font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">154.	The s. 3(11) submission asserts that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the ECtHR has held that the deportation to [Country X] of persons alleged to be terrorists will violate Article 3 of the ECHR, and there is no subsequent judgment which suggests that there has been any recent, material change in the conditions facing such persons in [Country X]</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. As a proposition of law suggestive of a bar to deportation, that is of course fundamentally misconceived. The Strasbourg court does not lay down general rules as to where a person may or may not be deported to in an overall sense. Rather, individual applications are decided on a case-by-case basis. A new Strasbourg decision is not required in order to permit a member state to take a different view of the situation in a particular country, especially where based on more up-to-date country material.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">155.	Furthermore, the submission contended that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the Minister acted unlawfully by failing to have regard to all relevant information and materials</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, specifically information and materials not put before the Minister by the applicant. That is an attempt to make a judicial review point by way of submissions; and for good measure in relation to matters for which the applicant is responsible by his failure to rely on this material in the first place. Again, it is an attempt to make a point regarding procedural (as opposed to substantive) illegality, which the Minister is under no obligation to consider favourably. At the risk of repetition, points regarding alleged lack of reasoning, alleged lack of fair procedures, or other procedural flaws in a deportation decision, are matters the Minister is free in her discretion to reject at the revocation stage. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">156.	Turning to the Strasbourg jurisprudence, starting with Daoudi, Mr. Farrell submits that that was a case on somewhat dated material from 2009.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">157.	Separately, he submits, in addition, the National Court of Asylum had accepted the risk of inhumane treatment but the exclusion clause applied (as indeed happened in the present case during the protection process) and the French Government did not produce evidence to contradict that. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">158.	As regards </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H.R</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">., the kernel of that decision is that there had been little change in the situation in Country X between the date of the judgment in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daoudi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on 3rd December, 2009, and 23rd February, 2011, when the state of emergency was ended. As the state of emergency had only recently been lifted, the court &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">did not have specific information capable of confirming or refusing the existence of such practices</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(&#8220;En raison du caract�re r�cent de la lev�e de l&#8217;�tat d&#8217;urgence, la Cour ne dispose d&#8217;aucun �l�ment concret permettant d&#8217;infirmer ou de confirmer cette pratique</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;), at para. 62. The decision was given on 22nd September, 2011.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">159.	Mr. Farrell submits that </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H.R.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> speaks to the necessity that a decision address the country material at a given point in time, and implicitly suggests that things may be changing in Country X, but at that point it was too soon to tell. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">160.	The decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.X</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. was delivered on 1st July, 2014. That is a decision rejecting the application as inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies (see para. 39). The un-availed of remedy was to apply for asylum, which would have given rise to a possible decision in the applicant&#8217;s favour (para. 37). Mr. Lynn accepts that there is no assessment of the conditions in Country X as of 2014. Thus, the decision does not assist on this point, or at all back up the point made in the s. 3(11) application by the applicant. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">161.	Mr. Farrell submits that there is no obligation to engage in an elaborate or any narrative analysis of caselaw, or indeed of anything submitted by the applicant, as long as the material is considered (as opposed to discussed) and the correct test is applied. I accept that approach and therefore the decision cannot be condemned for not narratively discussing the Strasbourg caselaw in a manner favourable to the applicant. As has been repeatedly stated, there is a fundamental distinction between the need to consider something and the (normally non-existent) need to narratively discuss it. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">162.	The Strasbourg caselaw does however indicate grounds for significant concern as to the situation in Country X up to September, 2011, but does not provide a definitive answer to the situation thereafter. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The situation post-September 2011 - Country information </font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">163.	The applicant relies on a body of country information supportive of the risk of secret detention of terrorist suspects, in particular;</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	the Human Rights Watch report of 2014, which refers to a legal framework which permits secret detention;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	the Amnesty International report of 2014.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">164.	The Minister&#8217;s decision relies on the U.S. State Department country report of 2015, published on 13th April, 2016, which makes no reference to secret places of detention and cites some improvements in the country situation. The report is far from exonerating the regime, in that it refers to allegations of torture. It also refers to impunity as remaining a problem. It refers to the permission for I.C.R.C. and local human rights groups to visit &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">regular</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; places of detention. To a substantial extent, ongoing issues are acknowledged in the Minister&#8217;s analysis which accepts significant concerns in relation to the situation in Country X. However, this does not in itself render invalid the Minister&#8217;s conclusion that there was not a risk to this particular applicant. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">165.	The 2015 State Department report had already been referred to in the underlying deportation decision (p. 9). Secret places of detention do not appear to have featured in the 2014 report either. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">166.	The applicant&#8217;s original submission under s. 3 relied on the 2013 US State Department report which stated that prison facilities in Country X did not meet international standards. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">167.	However, the 2014 and 2015 US State Department reports held differently and stated that Country X detention conditions &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">generally met international standards</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. Curiously, the 2015 report was available when the applicant made his original submission, but he chose to rely on out-of-date material.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">168.	The applicant himself then relied on the 2015 report at the s. 3(11) stage, but then, remarkably, in submissions criticised the Minister for placing reliance on it. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">169.	Finally, Mr. Lynn expressed some mystification as to why there was a reference to the situation having improved since 2013; but 2013 was clearly a reference back to a date relied on in the original submission made on behalf of his own client. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">170.	The ultimate decision is to the effect that the evidence put forward &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">does not contain any significant new information&#8221; </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">and</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#8220;does not have sufficient weight to establish that [the applicant] is at risk of torture and inhuman treatment</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (p. 11). This was a conclusion that was open to the Minister on the full range of material available. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The UK decisions 2008-16</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">171.	The UK material relied on is not directly relevant.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">172.	</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">B.B</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. (18th April, 2016) is not in point as Mr. Lynn accepts, in that it is a case where there seems to have been no real contest on the issue of risk in relation to the particular applicants and the issue was one of mitigation and assurances. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">173.	By contrast, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sihali</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (26th March, 2010) took the view that the system of assurances was robust enough to alleviate any real risk. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">174.	In the applicant&#8217;s submission, reliance is placed (without reasons or elaboration) on SIAC decisions in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H.S.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2008] UKAIT 00048, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">A.F.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2009] UKAIT 00023 and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">A.H.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2013] UKUT 00382. Two of these are of some vintage predating </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H.R</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">., and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">A.H</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. is an exclusion decision under Article 1F of the Geneva Convention in which the risk to the applicant was based on a protection finding and was not put in issue.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alleged invalidity of, or lack of reasons in, the decision in the light of this material</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">175.	Mr. Lynn submits that, on the information referred to by the decision-maker, the finding that the applicant is not at real risk is lacking in reasons, and is unreasonable and irrational. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">176.	It is submitted that in assessing unreasonableness the court must look at the overall quality of the decision, its reasoning and the information relied on. Reliance was placed on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Meadows</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, but that decision related to a finding of inadequacy in a bald and unreasoned assertion that s. 5 of the 1996 Act was not in issue. </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Meadows</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> decided that, within the contours of the traditional </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Keefe</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> test, there was flexibility to ensure that a decision affecting fundamental rights was itself proportional. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">177.	It is submitted that in the case of &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">an arguable breach of an absolute right, the range of reasonable findings open to the decision maker is necessarily more limited than in, e.g., a planning decision not involving any absolute right</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. That is an issue more of reasonableness rather than proportionality, because the test under art. 3 of the ECHR is an absolute one, so there can be no question of balancing of rights or proportionality of impact. Thus, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.Y</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">., Faherty J. at para. 65 referred to the need for a &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">rigorous</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; assessment of art. 3 issues and a clear statement of what principles were applied, and how the applicant&#8217;s specific submissions were addressed (citing </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">B.M. Eritrea v. Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2013] IEHC 324, Unreported, McDermott J., 16th July, 2013).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">178.	Article 8(2)(b) of the procedures directive (Directive 2005/85/EC) requires member states to obtain precise and up-to-date information from various sources including UNHRC in relation to the situation prevailing in countries of origin and transit countries in the context of an asylum claim. By analogy, it seems to me that the requirements of art. 3 of the ECHR should be taken to be similarly exacting. However even if the Minister did not consider all possible general country material (and it was not argued that she should have), she did consider a great deal of such material going well beyond a representative sample. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">179.	I accept the respondent&#8217;s contention at para. 34 of the statement of opposition that &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the Respondent was entitled to find and did find that &#8216;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the report makes no reference to secret places of detention and it indicates that detention practices, standards and monitoring have improved significantly since the report of 2013&#8217;. </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is therefore further denied that the Respondent failed to outline her reasons and / or any cogent or adequate basis for this finding / analysis as alleged or at all</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#8221; In addition, reliance was placed on the personal circumstances of the applicant. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">180.	Even if the country material had not shown an improvement in the situation, the applicant&#8217;s brother represents &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">a control sample</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, as Mr. Farrell puts it, being a person who has returned to Country X with a terrorist conviction with a similar background. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">181.	The s. 3(11) application only relies on extremely limited and selective country material: a Canadian report of 2006, and the US State Department country report of 2015 (which was already before the Minister at the deportation stage and oddly was enclosed again by the applicant on making the s. 3(11) application). No other country information is relied upon by the applicant. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">182.	It is clear from the ECHR caselaw that there are a number of essential elements to assessing an art. 3 claim:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	in order to determine whether there is a risk of ill-treatment, the decision-maker must examine the foreseeable consequences of sending the applicant to the receiving country, bearing in mind the general situation there and his or her personal circumstances (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Vilvarajah</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">and Others</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, para. 108; </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saadi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, para. 130);</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	the mere possibility of ill-treatment on account of an unsettled situation in the receiving country does not in itself give rise to a breach of art. 3 (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Vilvarajah and Others</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, para. 111, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fatgan Katani and Others v. Germany</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (dec.), (Application no. 67679/01, European Court of Human Rights, 31 May, 2001; </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saadi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, para. 131);</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	where the sources available to it describe a general situation, an applicant's specific allegations in a particular case require corroboration by other evidence (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mamatkulov and Askarov</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, para. 73; </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M�slim</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, para. 68; </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saadi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, para. 131);</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv).	in cases where an applicant alleges that he or she is a member of a group systematically exposed to a practice of ill-treatment, the protection of art. 3 of the ECHR enters into play when the applicant establishes that there are serious reasons to believe in the existence of the practice in question and his or her membership of the group concerned (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Salah Sheekh v. Netherlands</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Application no. 1948/04, European Court of Human Rights, 11th January, 2007), paras. 138-149);</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v).	it is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he or she would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to art. 3 (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">N. v. Finland</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, no. 38885/02, para. 167, 26 July 2005; </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saadi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> para. 129);</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi).	where such evidence is adduced, it is for the Government to dispel any doubts about it (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saadi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> para. 129).</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">183.	This approach does not meaningfully apply to a mere pro forma art. 3 claim, or one with no, or insubstantial, grounds, because such a claim never gets over the hurdle at para. (v) above. It is important to emphasise that, as discussed in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform v. Rettinger</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2010] 3 I.R. 783 at p. 816, paras. 78-79, the person must first produce &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">evidence of sufficient substance that, if uncontradicted, would oblige the [state] to refuse to surrender him</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. The position arising from </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saadi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, at paras. 128 to 133, is that the obligation to consider the general situation and the applicant&#8217;s personal circumstances only arises if the person first adduces &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that &#8230; he would be exposed to a real risk</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; of inhuman treatment. An examination of the country material and the applicant&#8217;s situation only arises in the context of dispelling doubts so raised: if the applicant fails to cross the first threshold, there are no doubts to dispel. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">184.	However, in the case of a person with a real and substantial art. 3 claim, the absolute nature of the prohibition under art. 3 and the clear jurisprudence from Strasbourg requires the Minister to consider the question having regard to the principles set out in the Strasbourg jurisprudence, the main elements of which are summarised above. That could be a very summary consideration if the matter is a revocation application and the point had already been discussed at the deportation order stage. Reference can be made back to the original decision in such circumstances. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">185.	In the case of an applicant, such as the present one, who has overcome that initial threshold, the onus then falls on the Minister to dispel the doubts by an examination of the general situation in the country and the personal circumstances of the individual. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">186.	The first leg of that duty involves an examination of the country situation. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">187.	It is clear that the Minister can have regard to such material as she may decide to obtain </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">proprio motu</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saadi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, para. 128, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">N v. Finland</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">188.	At the hearing, some discussion arose as to whether the Minister was obliged (as opposed to entitled) to consider, of her own motion, either a full suite of, or a representative sample of, generally recognised country reports, whether raised by an applicant or not. However, this point was expressly abandoned by Mr. Lynn on 15th December, 2016, and he confined his challenge to a failure to consider the material actually submitted by the applicant rather than to an assessment of the country information as a whole. That abandonment speaks for itself; the applicant is not making any point that the Minister failed to take a holistic view on the up to date country material. That posture hardly speaks of confidence that a full review of the up-to-date country material is supportive of the applicant&#8217;s case or of a view that the severity of risk in Country X, as existed in September 2011 at the time of the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H.R</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. decision, continues at the present time. Such a stance appears to turn the case into legal point-scoring regarding failure to consider very limited cherry-picked materials selected by the applicant, rather than being a claim about the reality of a risk of inhumane treatment. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">189.	Furthermore, by failing to pursue the question of the duty of the Minister to consider general country materials of her own motion, indeed by expressly abandoning it, as well as by failing to take up a suggestion during the hearing to seek an order that the respondent give further and better reasons (as in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">RPS Consulting Engineers Ltd. v. Kildare Co. Council</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IEHC 113, paras. 106-111), the applicant can hardly be said to have exhausted domestic remedies for the purposes of art. 26 of the ECHR. Such remedies cannot be postponed because, in domestic law, remedies going to the validity of a decision on an application under s. 3 or regarding revocation must be sought in the context of an action initiated within 28 days from the decision complained of. Given the procedural exclusivity of the s. 5 procedure, there is no &#8220;later&#8221; to which any points of challenge to the deportation decisions could be postponed. The present action was the only vehicle within which any and all such arguments could have been advanced. I do not consider that the obiter comments of Hogan J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">C.A. v. Governor of Cloverhill Prison </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2017] IECA 46, at paras. 30 to 31, can be taken to suggest otherwise, because he is speaking of a completely independent illegality that occurs for the first time during the detention due to the cessation of an intention to deport, and not an illegality traceable to the original deportation order or an affirmation of it. Any suggestion that an applicant could, in any subsequent proceedings (including Article 40 proceedings), raise issues which amount to a collateral challenge to a deportation order or any other decision subject to s. 5 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, would fly in the face of the decision of the Supreme Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Re Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill 1999</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2000] 2 I.R. 360, at 398-399, per curiam.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">190.	In the present case the s. 3(11) decision does deal in a summary manner with the country situation (mainly by reference back to the original material) and with further discussion of the material in the s. 3(11) material, together with reference to the personal circumstances of the applicant (2nd para. on p. 14). No illegality has been demonstrated. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alleged failure to be satisfied that improvements are significant and non-temporary</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">191.	It is submitted that, insofar as matters have allegedly improved in Country X, the appropriate test is that such improvement must be &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">significant and non-temporary</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, relying by analogy on art. 11(2) and 16(2) of the qualification directive 2004/83/EC. The directive itself acknowledges (recital 25) that it draws on international obligations. However, the Minister relied on recent country reports; and a change in circumstances that is significant and non-temporary enough to influence a country report that can reasonably be taken to fit that criterion, all other things being equal. Overall, the country material in relation to Country X shows a pattern of continuous improvement. The latest changes fit into that pattern. If it was lawful for the Minister to arrive at the conclusion she did by reference to updated country material, then that conclusion was not invalid by reference to any failure to consider whether, or find that, the changes were significant and non-temporary. There is no magic formula to be used in decisions, and the decision is not invalid because the words &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">significant and non-temporary</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; are not used. Yet again, it is not for the applicant or the court to dictate the form and wording of administrative decisions. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Conclusion and order</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">192.	One approach to litigation is that urged by Lord Pearce, speaking of lawyers who, &#8220;&#8230;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">where ten possible points were available &#8230; ruthlessly select the best, sacrifice nine, and thereby win on the tenth</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rondel v. Worsley</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1969] 1 A.C. 191, at p. 255-256). By contrast, in the present case, the applicant expressly abandoned the point that a holistic view of the country material should be taken and that the Minister should be required, in a case where the applicant overcomes the burden of a prima facie real risk under art. 3, to take into account all (or at least a representative set) of the most recent major country reports of her own motion. In place of that point, no less than sixteen grounds, not counting sub-grounds, have been urged upon me, each one a tottering construction of intricate legal complexity. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">193.	In the course of the process of making and affirming her </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">refoulement</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> decision, a decision that under law is hers, and not one where the tribunal&#8217;s views are binding, the Minister had regard to a large body of country material which is set out in an annex to this judgment. That material supports the view that the situation in Country X has improved step by step over a lengthy period of time. The conclusion that this applicant is not at real risk of treatment contrary to art. 3 was lawfully open to the Minister, particularly having regard to the more recent country material and to the personal circumstances of the applicant, having regard to his general lack of credibility, and also the fact that his brother, also a convicted terrorist, is not being subjected to torture in Country X. The notable features of the case include the following:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	the relevant Strasbourg caselaw was before the Minister and was considered;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	the Minister considered 35 separate pieces of country information, set out below, in the overall course of her assessment of the general situation in the country;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	that information shows continued improvement over time in the general situation in the country concerned;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv).	the Minister considered the individual circumstances of the applicant including his general lack of credibility and the fact that his brother, also a convicted terrorist, is not being subject to treatment contrary to art. 3 in the country concerned;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v).	the applicant&#8217;s credibility is seriously impaired by his multiple identities, fraudulent previous asylum application, history of incorrect representations, criminal history in multiple jurisdictions and disregard of the immigration systems of multiple jurisdictions;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi).	those incorrect representations included false representations to the Minister as recently as November, 2016, in which he sought to incorrectly assert that his brother G.Y. had no terrorist convictions, thereby seeking to explain why he had a fear of ill-treatment even though the brother had not been subject to treatment contrary to art. 3;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vii).	the Minister applied the correct test as laid down in the Strasbourg jurisprudence and found an absence of substantial grounds to apprehend a real risk of treatment contrary to art. 3 of the ECHR in the case of this applicant;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(viii).	after the present proceedings were initiated, and in order to ensure that all matters were fully considered, I adjourned the proceedings to allow the applicant the option of making a further submission to the Minister, by way of application to revoke the deportation order, thereby affording the applicant every opportunity to make his case in this regard;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ix).	in determining the present judicial review I have also fully considered the relevant Strasbourg jurisprudence as set out in this judgment;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(x).	the applicant has expressly abandoned any contention that the Minister should have, of her own motion, considered all or a representative sample of up-to-date core human rights reports on the country concerned;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(xi).	such a withdrawal is not consistent with any argument that an up-to-date assessment of all, or a representative sample of, core human rights reports would have been supportive of a real risk of treatment contrary to art. 3 in this case;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(xii).	the applicant also failed to pursue the option of seeking an order that further and better reasons should be provided, if there was any inadequacy in the reasoning of the Minister;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(xiii).	such a withdrawal, and such a failure, constitutes a failure to exhaust domestic remedies because domestic law requires any challenge to the deportation order and affirmation decision to be made in the context of the present proceedings, being the only proceedings instituted within 28 days of the notification of such decisions;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(xiv).	there is no evidence that a consideration of the latest such additional core human rights reports would have produced a fundamentally different conclusion from that drawn from the latest Amnesty and U.S. State Department reports, which were considered by the Minister; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(xv).	contemporary judicial review, which has been made available to the applicant, provides a searching and exacting independent remedy for a determination by the Minister in respect of whether a risk of treatment contrary to art. 3 arises; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(xvi).	on such review I find that the Minister&#8217;s conclusion, that there are not substantial grounds for considering that there is a real risk of treatment contrary to art. 3 in the event of the deportation of the applicant, was lawful. </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">194.	Accordingly, I will order:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i).	that the application be dismissed;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii).	that the matter be adjourned to a date to be fixed to permit any application for leave to appeal; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii).	that the stay on actual removal of the applicant from the State (which does not restrain the detention of the applicant on foot of the deportation order or the enforcement otherwise of the order) do continue pending the determination of any such application or further order in the meantime; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv).	that the restriction on the publication of material tending to identify the applicant do continue on a permanent basis; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v).	that the restriction on reporting the country of origin of the applicant do continue until further order; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi).	in the event of the lifting of that restriction, a revised version of this judgment may be prepared to remove redaction of the country name. </font>
