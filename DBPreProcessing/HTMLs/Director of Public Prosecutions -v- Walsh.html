             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGEMENT (ex tempore) of the Court delivered on the 9th day of February 2017 by Mr. Justice Mahon</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. On 9th November 2015 at the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court the respondent pleaded guilty to two counts of having an article in an public place with intention to intimidate another, namely Frances and Leanne Nevin, contrary to s. 9(5) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990. On 14th December 2015 the respondent was sentenced to prison terms of two years and six months in respect of each of the counts, sentences to run concurrently. The entire term was suspended for three years on condition that the respondent would undergo supervision by the Probation Service for eighteen months, and avoid contact with the injured parties.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The appellant seeks a review of the said sentences on the ground that they are unduly lenient, pursuant to s. 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993. The grounds on which the application is brought are as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) The offending behaviour was very serious;</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) the respondent has a serious record of violent crime;</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) the respondent&#x2019;s presence on nearby streets to the location of the injured parties&#x2019; residence is having an adverse effect on them;</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) the learned sentencing judge overly concentrated on the mitigating factors and on efforts at rehabilitation;</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v) the pleas of guilty had been entered on a full facts basis. Those facts concerned more than one confrontation between the respondent and the victims, the making of threat to kill or cause serious harm to them and the showing of a firearm by the respondent to the victims;</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi) the sentence imposed, and in particular the suspension of the entire sentence, is inadequate punishment and is not a sufficient deterrent to others;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. On a date in December 2013 a verbal altercation arose as between, on one side the respondent and his partner, Isabel Byrne, and on the other side, Frances Nevin, who also lived in the locality of Priorswood, Dublin 17. Later that day Ms. Nevin visited the home of Ms. Byrne in an effort to sort out their differences. Ms. Nevin was again verbally abused by Ms. Byrne whereupon the respondent arrived on the scene and joined in the verbal attack against Ms. Nevin. He threatened to kill Ms. Nevin and to have her killed by someone else within the next twenty four hours. He lifted his jacket to reveal a handgun tucked into the waistband of his trousers. The handgun was seen by Ms. Nevin and her daughter, Leanne, who was also present and both feared for their lives. It was also alleged that the respondent had threatened Leanne Nevin at the same time as he threatened her mother, telling her that he would bounce her head off a wall. The two women sought refuge with a neighbour, Carmel Garbutt, and the gardaí were contacted. Later that day, the gardaí gave chase to the respondent through a park whereupon he was arrested and taken to Coolock garda station. Gardaí located a hand gun and a number of silver metal capsules at the entrance to the park close to where the respondent was arrested.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The gun in question was a low velocity weapon which fired pellets, and was not a firearm in the common use of that term. However, it resembled a firearm and appeared to the victims to be a firearm capable of killing them or causing serious injury. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 provides as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) If it appears to the Director of Public Prosecutions that a sentence imposed by a court &#x2026; on conviction of a person on indictment was unduly lenient, he may apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentence. </font></i> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) An application under this section shall be made on notice given to the convicted person within 28 days from the day on which the sentence was imposed. </font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) On such an application the Court may either:-</font></i> </p>
               <ul>
                <br> 
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) quash the sentence and in place of it impose on the convicted person such sentence as it considers appropriate, being a sentence which could have been imposed on him by the sentencing court concerned, or </font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) refuse the application.&#x201d;</font></i></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The respondent has fifteen previous convictions most of them from some years ago, two which are for robbery and producing a blood filled syringe, and also for assault causing harm. He also has a history of drug addiction and was deemed by the Probation Service as having a moderate risk of re-offending.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. In her sentencing judgment the learned sentencing judge described the offences as serious and which had significant ongoing effects on the victims, particularly Leanne Nevin. She noted the previous existence of fifteen previous convictions but believed them to be of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;some antiquity&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. She also noted that the respondent was struggling with his heroin addiction and had recently relapsed. She deemed the offence to lie at the &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">lower upper end of the spectrum&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in terms of its gravity. She went on to state:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;In relation to his personal circumstances he is a recovering chronic heroin addict who had a difficult childhood. The probation officer has categorised him in the moderate risk of re-offending over the next twelve months. For a man who had such a traumatic childhood and addiction issues and for one who has spent so much time incarcerated he has coped reasonably well and has been doing well within the community. He is now married, in a stable relationship, and has a home which are significant stabilising factors for him having previously been homeless. The probation officer states that she was told that he did not plead guilty earlier because he feared that he and his wife would lose their home. He accepts responsibility for his actions and appears to accept the seriousness of the offence.&#x201d;</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">8. Victim impact statements from both victims were made available to the court. Leanne Nevin described how she was in fifth year at school at the time and that she missed a lot of school in the following year, being her leaving certificate year, because she was terrified she would bump into the respondent in her neighbourhood. She said that she still continued to be fearful when leaving her home because of the proximity of the respondent&#x2019;s home. She said that she leaves early to go to college to avoid bumping into him. Frances Nevin explained the concern she has for her daughter and the effect it has had on her daughter&#x2019;s education. She describes how she has become fearful when leaving her home or around the local shops in case she meets the respondent. She feels intimidated by him when she sees him and alleges that he has laughed at her and said things to her. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. It is well established that when considering an application by the appellant to review a sentence on the grounds that it was unduly lenient, the court must be satisfied that the sentence imposed was more than simply lenient. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">DPP v. McCormack</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2000] I.R. 356, Barron J. stated in the course of his judgment:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;Each case must depend upon its special circumstances. The appropriate sentence depends not only upon its own facts but also upon the personal circumstances of the accused. The sentence to be imposed is not the appropriate sentence for the crime, but the appropriate sentence for the crime because it has been committed by that accused. The range of possible penalties is dependant upon those two factors. It is only when the penalty is below the range as determined on this basis that the question of undue leniency may be considered&#x2026;&#x201d;</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Unusually in this case, and of concern to the Court, is the fact t
