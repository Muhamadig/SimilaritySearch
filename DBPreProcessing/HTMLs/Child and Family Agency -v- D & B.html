             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> There is also an application for a Care Order pursuant to section 18 of the 1991 Act, which has not been allocated a hearing date. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Evidence has been heard over a period of four days, a substantive hearing, in relation to this application. The Court heard evidence from two social workers; one social worker who has been allocated to Child 1 and Child 2, and another social worker allocated to Child 3 and Child 4. The Court also heard evidence from the team leader who supervises the work of the two social workers, a public health nurse, a family support worker, a family support servicer from an independent children&#x2019;s charity, and a worker within a crèche, where one of the children attends. I heard evidence from the respondent father and from the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Guardian Ad Litem.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. I have considered all of the evidence and all material that has been admitted to the Court by consent. It is to be noted that any specific reference to anything in this decision is not to be taken that I have not considered all of the material that has been submitted to me in evidence, or by virtue of admitted material. Any reference to particular facts is not to be taken as an exclusion of consideration of all the material circumstances of this case as outlined and opened to me. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. It is the case that the four children, the subject of these proceedings, have been known to social services since 2010. There have been six child protection case conferences that have taken place between 2015 and 2016. In the evidence, it appears that the father and the mother reside at different houses, with the children residing at the residence of the mother and that some of the children spend overnight visits at the father's residence. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. At the outset of the proceedings it was outlined to the Court that the Child and Family Agency were applying for the making of an Interim Care Order which, pursuant to legislation, can be for a period of 28 days. The </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Guardian Ad Litem</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, who was appointed to these four children to represent their views, wishes, and welfare to the Court, as an independent channel for such and to assist the Court, was appointed in 2016. The Guardian supports the making of an Interim Care Order in relation to all four children. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. It was outlined to me at the beginning of this case that the respondent mother and father both agree that an Interim Care Order is necessary for three months for the two younger children. However, they want and seek the return of the two older children to the care of the respondent father who, it was advanced to me through his solicitor, would agree to a Supervision Order being put in place and would consent to a parenting capacity assessment being carried out by the Child and Family Agency in the meantime. The Court notes that these four children have been the subject of two voluntary admissions to care, once in 2015 for a period of three months, and again in 2016 where the four children were placed into voluntary care and where they remain to this day. These four children have, therefore, already had the traumatic experience of leaving the care of their parents and being placed in foster care. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. After reviewing all of the evidence, I find the following as fact. I am satisfied that these four children, and their circumstances when they were in the care of their parents, reached the level of neglect and abuse that requires them to be made the subject of an Interim Care Order for their care and protection. I am satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that the children have suffered neglect consistently while in the care of their parents and they are likely to suffer neglect if returned to their parents at this time. I am also satisfied that Interim Care Orders are necessary for their care and protection of these four children. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. I find as fact that the mother and father have co-parented, albeit in circumstances where the father does not stay overnight, in the family residence. I am satisfied that co-parenting with shared responsibility was what was happening in the experience of these four children. I am satisfied that the four children resided in a home and that the level of hygiene included a risk to the safety and welfare of these children. I am satisfied that there was consistent neglect of the children&#x2019;s basic needs, to include safety, exposure to being unsupervised and/or being neglected. I am satisfied that both the father and mother, as co-parents, are responsible for these circumstances. I do not believe it is open to one co-parent to neglect by omission, being fully aware of the actual circumstances of the children and to allow that situation to continue. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. I instanced one occasion where the father was visited in the home by a professional who was seeking to provide family support and there was a lack of appropriate sterilisation and appropriate and safe bedding for an infant child. Child 2&#x2019;s presentation, in particular, was such that the child's right when he attended crèche to be able to engage with his peers and to enjoy his own life, was compromised to a substantial degree by the manner in which he was left out by his parents to deal with the world. I believe that this constituted consistent neglect by the parents. This Court is not in the business of perfect parenting or pristine hygiene, but the level of hygiene that was outlined to the Court in this case is such that I believe that the children's right to enjoyment and basic safety in their lives was compromised. It is noteworthy that the father, in his own evidence, could not see or recall the state of Child 2, which was evidenced to me by a worker from Child 2&#x2019;s crèche, and I accepted the evidence of that witness in that regard. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. I have found as a fact that both parents did not engage with the social workers, an independent children&#x2019;s charity and the family support services to a degree required to actually create real improvement and change in the circumstances of their children's lives. I find that there was a consistent failure by both parents to meet the basic needs of their children. I find as a fact that the respondent mother has abused drugs and that the respondent father has chosen not to deal with this fact, even though it has and is impacting on the lives, welfare and basic care needs of his four children. I find as fact that the respondent father has demonstrated carelessness in his use of alcohol, such that the welfare of the children could reasonably be compromised. I believe that the respondent mother and respondent father have not demonstrated to this court and I find it as a fact, the level of skills, basic, as regards their children's essential fundamental needs for care on a consistent basis. I believe that the children have not been cared for to a good enough standard of parenting. Medical appointments have been missed and I find as a fact that this was a joint responsibility of both these parents. I believe that the respondent father has not demonstrated an insight into the children's basic needs and the respondent mother has not ensured that the children's basic needs were met on a consistent basis.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. The children are currently in voluntary care and they have already experienced the trauma of coming into care. I believe that their care and protection requires that they are made the subject of an Interim Care Order at this time. However, I believe that the following should occur in the meantime, enabled by the making of an Interim Care Order; </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">A. the Child and Family Agency should arrange a parenting capacity assessment of the respondent father without delay, to include cognitive assessment; </font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">B. the Child and Family Agency should provide a roadmap to both parents outlining what they must do for family reunification to occur; </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">C. the Child and Family Agency should support the respondent mother to continue with her addiction treatment; </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">D. the Child and Family Agency should liaise with both respondent parents and the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Guardian Ad Litem </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">as to what the children are to be informed about their current care status. </font></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">12. It is noteworthy in this case that both respondent parents are very good with their children at access and that the children are bonded to their parents. This is a case where the actual abilities of the parents are not known and the roadmap for reunification must identify supports tailored to these particular parents' weaknesses and strengths. I am satisfied that State interference in the family life of these children and parents is a necessary interference on
