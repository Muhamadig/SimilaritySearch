             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Judgment delivered on the 20th day of February, 2017 by Denham C.J.</font></b> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Background</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This is an appeal brought by Edward O’Neill, the plaintiff/appellant, and hereinafter referred to as the “the plaintiff”, from the judgment of the High Court (Hedigan J.) dated the 25th March, 2011, and order, which was perfected on the 8th June, 2011. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. McCann Fitzgerald Solicitors, the first named defendant/respondent, referred to individually as “the first named defendant”, brought a motion in the High Court to strike out the plaintiff’s claim as against them.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The High Court struck out the plaintiff’s proceedings as against the first named defendant, which is the decision the subject of this appeal. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Proceedings</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">4. On the 19th January, 2011, the plaintiff instituted High Court proceedings against the defendants by way of plenary summons, claiming a range of remedies, including damages for nuisance, breach of constitutional rights and orders for discovery, and he delivered a statement of claim on the 3rd February, 2011.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The plaintiff’s claim arose out of a dispute between the plaintiff and Statoil (U.K.) Limited, which is referred to as “Statoil”, concerning an allegation by the plaintiff that Statoil authorised the plaintiff to act as its agent in the negotiation of oil supply contracts, and that Statoil is indebted to him in respect of a considerable amount of money.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The first named defendant was retained by Statoil to acts as its solicitors in this dispute.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. Acting as solicitors for Statoil, the first named defendant sent to the plaintiff correspondence on behalf of Statoil, which stated that Statoil believed that the plaintiff’s claim was entirely without merit.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. The complaints made by the plaintiff in these proceedings are as to acts of the first named defendant taken when acting as solicitors for Statoil.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. The nature of the plaintiff’s claim is summarised in the judgment of the learned High Court judge at paragraph 2, as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> “(1) The first defendant engaged in a conspiracy with the other defendants to deny him his entitlement to the monies he claims.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (2) That this defendant engaged a private detective whose activities are threatening him and his family.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (3) He alleges this defendant co-ordinated efforts with the other defendants to make fraudulent allegations against him.”</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. By Notice of Motion dated the 7th March, 2011, the first named defendant brought an application seeking orders, pursuant to the Rules of the Superior Courts and the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, striking out the plaintiff’s claim on the grounds that the allegations raised by the him in his plenary summons and statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and were bound to fail. Further, that the allegations were frivolous and vexatious, and an abuse of process, and ought to be struck out.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. The learned High Court judge invited counsel for the first named defendant to open the relevant documentation to the Court and, having read through the written replies prepared by the plaintiff, heard a number of matters from the plaintiff in reply. Having reserved judgment in order to consider the papers further, Hedigan J. delivered the judgment of the High Court on the 25th May, 2011.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Hedigan J. referred to the test to be applied by a Court in considering whether proceedings should be struck out, as stated by the High Court (Kelly J.) in </font><a href="1996"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bernadette Ennis v. Colm Butterly </font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 1 I.R. 426. Hedigan J, at paragraph 3 of his judgment, summarised the principles as set out in that case as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> “(1) Where no reasonable cause of action is disclosed.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (2) Where the proceedings are frivolous and vexatious.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (3) Where the claim is clearly unsustainable.”</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">13. Applying the above criteria to each of the three aspects of the plaintiff’s claim, outlined in paragraph 9 above, the learned High Court judge granted the application of the first named defendant to strike out the proceedings. In relation to the three aspects of the plaintiff’s claim the High Court held:-</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13.(i) Conspiracy with other defendants</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> In respect of the first aspect of the plaintiff’s claim, which concerned his allegation that the first named defendant conspired with other defendants to deprive the plaintiff of monies he alleges are owed to him, the learned High Court judge noted that the plaintiff had not issued any proceedings claiming the monies he alleged were owed to him. On examination of every communication between the plaintiff and the first-named defendant, he found that each was typical of a communication sent by a solicitor in the preliminary stages of proceedings, and reflected an appropriate defence of the interests of their clients. The learned High Court judge noted that no reasonable cause of action arose out of the first named defendant having acted on the instructions of Statoil to vigorously defend the plaintiff’s claim.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13.(ii) Engaging a private detective</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The second aspect of the plaintiff’s claim related to an allegation that he received a threatening email from a private detective via an encrypted email service, which could only be accessed by the recipient knowing or guessing the password. The learned High Court judge considered that, given the dubious nature of the email and the tenuous linking of the first named defendant, this claim was clearly unsustainable.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. (iii) Co-ordinating with the other defendants to make fraudulent allegations </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> This claim concerns an allegation by the plaintiff that the first named defendant is linked to an allegation of fraud made against him in the United States of America. Hedigan J. noted that this claim appeared to be based on the fact that the first named defendant confirmed to U.S. lawyers that the plaintiff had made a claim against Statoil. The learned High Court judge could find nothing to support this claim.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> In the course of his judgment, Hedigan J. noted that the first named defendant is entitled to communicate with the U.S. lawyers, and that there is no basis upon which the plaintiff may claim that they should not engaged with the firm. Furthermore. Hedigan J noted that solicitors have every right to engage the services of a private investigator, which is common practice in litigation.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Appeal to the Supreme Court</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">14. The plaintiff, by way of a Notice of Appeal filed on the 27th June, 2011, appealed the judgment of the High Court to this Court.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. I have considered the written submissions and papers submitted by the plaintiff and the first named defendant. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. In making oral submissions to the Court, the plaintiff, who represented himself, described personal difficulties he had faced since, he stated, there were allegations broadcast that he had received a large sum of money by fraud. While anyone would have a concern for him as he described his personal difficulties, the issue before the Court is the appeal from the decision of the High Court, which in turn related to the proceedings brought by the plaintiff.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. The Court heard oral submissions on the 1st December, 2016. The matters raised by the plaintiff on appeal
