             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of the Court delivered 20th March 2017 by Mr. Justice Edwards.</font></b> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Introduction</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The respondents each pleaded guilty to four counts involving various offences contrary to the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended, each count of which carried a potential maximum sentence of five years imprisonment. In each case the charges, which related to specified time periods, comprised two counts of knowingly or wilfully delivering an incorrect return in connection with Value Added Tax, one count of claiming a repayment of tax to which there was no entitlement and one count of failing to keep for the period of time specified by law records of all transactions relating to Value Added Tax. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. On the 18th of June 2015 the respondents were both sentenced to three years imprisonment, to be suspended for a period of three years. The Director now seeks a review of those sentences on the grounds that they are unduly lenient. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Facts of the case</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The respondents, a father and son, were directors of Slattery Ventures Limited (&#x201c;the company&#x201d;). The company carried on trade which was subject to VAT and became registered in respect of VAT on the 5th September, 2005. The company owned fast food outlets at a number of locations in Limerick City and County, including at Ballycummin Village, Raheen, Co Limerick and at The Racefield Centre, Father Russell Road, Dooradoyle, Limerick, as well as a retail premises comprising a garage and shop in the village of Clarina, Co Limerick.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. In 2008, the company was selected for a revenue audit on account of not having registered for the plastic bag levy. On the 11th of February 2008, the Revenue Commissioners issued a letter to the company advising it that it had been selected for a revenue audit.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. Mr. Tony Ryan, a Higher Executive Officer at the Revenue Commissioners conducted the audit. On the 29th of April 2008 Mr. Ryan met with the respondents. At that point they opted not to make a voluntary disclosure. A number of irregularities were identified by Mr. Ryan.</font><br> </p>
             <div align="center">

              <b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Z Reads&#x201d;</font></i></b>
              <b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and Sales returns</font></b>
             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. First, there were issues relating to the </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;z read&#x201d;</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x2013; a feature of modern tills whereby a report is produced detailing the total sales for a particular day or shift. Once a </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;z read&#x201d;</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> report is produced for a particular day or shift the cash register resets the </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;z-read&#x201d;</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> counter to zero for the commencement of the next day or shift. Modern electronic cash registers also have a feature known as the Non Resettable Gross Total (NRGT) function which maintains a running total of all sales which can be accessed at any time. However, it is technically possible for a person with the requisite &#x201c;know how&#x201d; to disable the NRGT function.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The company&#x2019;s record keeping appears to have been chaotic. When asked for the company&#x2019;s records, Mr. Ryan was simply presented with two cardboard boxes filled with these </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;z reads&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. On going through them Mr. Ryan discovered a pattern of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;skipping every second z read&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the till at the Ballycummin premises, resulting in a significant amount of cash receipts not being recorded, incorrect sales figures consequently being entered on VAT returns and less VAT being remitted to the Revenue Commissioners than was in fact due.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. The cash register in use at the Ballycummin premises was a brand new cash register acquired in early September 2006. For approximately the first seven weeks during which this new cash register was in use, the NGRT function was operating. Thereafter it appears to have been deliberately disabled. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. In respect of the period from the 11th of September, 2006 to the 30th of October, 2006, during which time the NGRT was operational, it was observed that cumulative sales were &#x20ac;113,212.40 but the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;daily Z readings&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the same period only totalled &#x20ac;83,626.16. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The prosecution case is that the practice of skipping every second z read continued for at least several two-month VAT periods thereafter and that the disablement of the NGRT function was a deliberate attempt to ensure that there was no running total recorded which could be compared with the figures actually returned.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. In addition, there was exceptionally poor record keeping overall. There were VAT accounting periods where no returns were made for the Clarina premises at all, and there were periods where sales at the Clarina premises were underreported by significant sums, and although a note was put into the records that VAT due for the Nov-Dec 2005 VAT period would be returned in VAT return for the Jan-Feb 2006 VAT period, that never in fact occurred. VAT was significantly underpaid in respect of the Clarina operation. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. In addition, there was significant inaccurate recording in, and lack of adequate supporting documentation in respect of, the purchases book. The purchases book was initially believed to be overstated by as much &#x20ac;144,343.40. However, documentation subsequently produced by the respondent&#x2019;s accountant suggested a possible eventual under-claim of as much as &#x20ac;29,000. However, regardless of this, no legitimate reclaim could have been made by the company in the periods in question given the concealment of large amounts of sales.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. A figure of &#x20ac;223,965 representing the estimated losses to the Revenue in the periods covered by the indictment was given in evidence. This breaks down into &#x20ac;112,253 in the case of Mr. Jonathan Slattery based on the returns that he signed, and &#x20ac;111,112 in the case of Mr. William Slattery based on the returns that he signed. The estimated outstanding liability of &#x20ac;223,965 was over and above the sum of &#x20ac;70,000 already recovered by the Revenue Sherriff.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. The prosecution case is that while the VAT liabilities/ irregularities arising in respect of Racefield premises and the Clarina premises might be explicable, at least in part, by poor record keeping, poor financial management and poor corporate governance, the VAT liabilities and irregularities arising at the Ballycummin premises were more sinister and involved premeditated and deliberate fraud. In regard to the latter, significant emphasis was placed on the fact that substantial monies, including VAT, received by the company were lodged to the respondents&#x2019; personal bank accounts. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. Between September 2005 and April 2008, &#x20ac;1,254,267.37 was lodged to the second respondent&#x2019;s personal account. During the same period, &#x20ac;112,966.83 was lodged to the first respondent&#x2019;s personal account. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. The respondents provided only very limited co-operation in the course of the revenue investigation. They made no admissions at interviews, and did not avail of the opportunity afforded to them to make voluntary disclosures.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. There was a relatively lengthy period between the initial audit, and the conclusion of the proceedings in the court below. The audit was carried out in 2008, the respondents were not charged until 2012, the respondents pleaded guilty in 2014 and sentencing did not occur until June 2015. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. In addition, this Court notes a further twenty months was allowed to elapse before this appeal was brought on for hearing. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The respondents&#x2019; personal circumstances</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">19. At the time of sentencing, the second named respondent, Mr. William Slattery, was aged 62 years, and was a married father of six adult children who had worked all his adult life. His son, the first named respondent, was a 35 year old father of one young child who had a long term partner. Neither respondent had any previous convictions.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. The sentencing judge noted that the respondents had suffered significant hardship since the audit. The company had gone into liquidation, leaving both respondents personally exposed in respect of outstanding debts. There is a risk of losing a family home &#x2013; the second respondent&#x2019;s home had been remortgaged to raise funds for the business. The second respondent had been on jobseekers allowance, while the first respondent earned a modest income of approximately &#x20ac;300 per week from work as a barman. It is understood that more recently the first named respondent has secured a somewhat better job as a Sales Representative and that he is presently on a salary of &#x20ac;30,000 per annum.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21. A sum of &#x20ac;35,000 was borrowed by the respondents from friends and was paid over to the Revenue by way of partial restitution in respect of the company&#x2019;s revenue liabilities. Very little, if any of this debt has been repaid and it remains largely extant.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22. It was suggested by counsel in their pleas in mitigation that in addition to financial hardship, the respondents have suffered, and will continue to suffer significant social stigma. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The sentencing judge&#x2019;s remarks</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">23. In passing sentence the sentencing judge, after summarizing the facts of the case, stated (inter alia): </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;In his summation to the Court Mr. O'Sullivan for the State stated that from the prosecution's point of view there are what are described as three main aspects of this case. Firstly, the wilful failure to remit the VAT. Secondly, knowing and deliberately making false returns. And thirdly, knowingly and wilfully claiming the rebate of VAT. The prosecution concede that the plea in this case is of very substantial value, as these cases are generally long, complex and time-consuming, and it often presents juries with the very difficult task of trying to grasp the rules and regulations in respect of the payment of VAT and the evidence tends to be very much of an accountancy area. Again the prosecution also pointed out that as a result of the plea the question of proving the mental element of the offences can be a difficult issue if the matter had gone to trial. There's also the question of the legal issues and arguments arising from a case of this nature, which again would have elongated the matter further. </font></i> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> In respect of the two accused, Mr. William Slattery is 62 years of age. He's a father of six adult children, as I understand, that he's always been in employment, and, as I understand remortgaged his family home to start this Slattery Ventures at the start. He also has no previous convictions at all of any description, sort or kind. In respect of Jonathan Slattery, he's 35 years of age, he's no previous convictions of any sort, he has a long term partner and an 18 month old child. And, as I understand that not alone has he had to deal with the Revenue, but there has been judgments in excess of &#x20ac;75,000 against his family home, which I understand is at risk. Insofar as the aggravating factors are concerned, despite what's contained in one of the probation reports, Mr. Slattery senior's matter, this was a deliberate and calculated affair. It is clear from the evidence of Mr. Ryan, and from a close examination of the records of this particular company that there was, as he described, this suppression of accurate information. There is the substantial loss of monies to the Revenue Commissioners and, by extension, the taxpayers in general, amounting to a figure, as I understand, of &#x20ac;223,000. There's the obvious breach of trust as between the taxpayer and the Revenue which is an essential element in our tax code. </font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Insofar as the mitigating factors are concerned, there is the early plea of guilty in this case, which, as already stated, the State have said is of enormous value. There's the considerable saving of court time as the case had the potential to be very long and time-consuming, complex and always the possibility of an acquittal. There is the suggestion that both the father and son were more culpable for their ill-equipped -- for their being ill-equipped to deal with such a number of businesses, their lack of business experience or qualification. There is the fact that the Revenue are satisfied that there was no secret accounts, as such, and nothing of that order. There is the cooperation with the Revenue, insofar as the investigation was concerned and full disclosure of the bank accounts. There's also the fact that neither accused has any previous conviction of any sort or kind, or indeed anything since. There is the chaotic nature of the manner in which the businesses were conducted and I think this is underpinned by virtue of the fact that I think Mr. Ryan, again in his evidence, quoted the fact that they were presented with a box full of receipts which were in a chaotic order, if "order" is the correct word to use at all. There is the fact that the companies have gone into liquidation, leaving both accused exposed personally in respect of debts still outstanding. There is the fact that both accused have been disqualified by order of the High Court from acting as directors for the foreseeable future. There is the risk of losing a family home and there's also the fact that homes -- Mr. Slattery senior's home was remortgaged in order to try and keep the business going. There is the complete lack of any trappings of wealth. There is the stigma that these convictions will attract. It appears now that the father, Mr. Slattery senior, is in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and the fact that Mr. Jonathan Slattery is working as a barman since November of 2013, earning approximately &#x20ac;300 per week and I have seen the testimonials that have been handed in in respect of the parties. There is the offer of a figure of &#x20ac;35,000 to the Revenue at this stage, being borrowed from friends, as such.</font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Mr. WHYMS: Judge, I wonder, if I might interrupt, I should have said this earlier. That money has actually been paid.</font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGE: I see, very well, okay. My understanding was that it was in court, but so be it. There is the length of time in this case and again I have to be extremely diplomatic, if that's the correct word, here and I know from my own experience sitting in courts that these matters take a very long time, but the audit in this particular case took place in 2008 for a period 2005. The accused were charged with the offences and returned for trial in May of 2012. There have been several adjournments and the accused both have pleaded guilty to various counts in 2014, May 2014, and the sentencing hearing, as such, took place in March of 2015 with the sentence to be imposed today. </font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">In respect of matters, it is now seven years since the audit took place and I can only imagine that this has been a very, very stressful time, albeit through their own actions, but for both accused in respect of matters. Again I don't want it to be seen as any criticism in the system because, insofar as it's concerned, my understanding that there were a number of adjournments granted for the purposes of allowing the defendants' accountant and the Revenue to examine the figures that were there, but nevertheless, it is a substantial length of time and it's something I feel that I can take into consideration as a mitigating feature.</font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also, this morning, have the benefit of the two probation reports in this particular case and it's interesting to note that the probation service are of the view that their input is no longer required and, in fact, there's no mention in either case that I can see in respect of any risk of reoffending.</font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Comment: insofar as matters of this nature are concerned, what is described as white-collar crime, the Court of Appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal as it was then, has given a number of very strong judgments suggesting that imprisonment is appropriate and proportionate in cases of this nature. I need only refer to matters such as the DPP v. Murray, the DPP v. Begley, which as the garlic/apple case, and the DPP v. Campbell. However, each case is dependent on its own special circumstances. The appropriate sentence depends not only upon the facts of each case, but also on the personal circumstances of the accused at the time of sentence. The sentence to be imposed is not only the appropriate sentence for the crime, but it is the appropriate sentence for the crime because the crime has been committed by the accused. I have a note here about the &#x20ac;35,000, which I understand had been paid over -- has been -- already been paid over. Insofar as further payments are concerned, the reality is that, at this particular time, there is no realistic prospect of any further compensation being paid, as such. It is a substantial figure and a substantial loss to the Revenue. However, I have to take each case as I find it and in each case, on each count, and that's in respect of -- sorry, Mr. John Slattery is on count 1, 7, 8 and 12. On each of those counts, I'm going to impose a sentence of three years. However, I'm going to suspend it for a period of three years, on condition that he enter a bond and be of good behaviour and keep the peace for that three-year period.</font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">In respect of Mr. William Slattery, he's pleaded guilty to counts 13, 17, 19 and 20 and in each of those cases he's convicted and sentenced to three years. Again, however, I'll suspend it for a period of three years on condition that he enter a bond to be of good behaviour and keep the peace during the period; each of the sentences to run concurrently and the bond, in each case, to be &#x20ac;200.&#x201d; </font></i></p>

             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">24. The Director&#x2019;s application criticises the sentence imposed in the following respects:</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The sentencing court erred in principle in imposing the said sentences on the respondent in respect of the said offences in that the said sentences were unduly lenient having regard to the nature, circumstances and gravity of the said offences and, in particular, the sentencing court, when sentencing the respondent, erred in principle in:</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) failing to identify an appropriate starting point at a sufficiently high level to reflect the nature of the said offences and the aggravating factors in the case;</font> </p>

               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) failing to reflect in the said sentences the following aggravating factors, namely:</font> </p>
               <ul>
                <br> 
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">i. the fact that the respondent, with his co-accused, was party to the wilful suppression, concealment and destruction of records which they were bound to keep and maintain;</font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ii. the fact that the respondent, with his co-accused, disabled a mechanism which was designed to generate and keep a permanent record of certain tills operated and used by the respondent and his co-accused;</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">iii. the fact that the respondent, and his co-accused, regularly placed sums of money received by them for and on behalf of Slattery Ventures Limited into certain private bank accounts in circumstances where the said funds included value added tax and in respect of which said monies the respondent, and his co-accused, had a fiduciary duty to return same to the Revenue Commissioners;</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">iv. the fact that the respondent failed to avail of the opportunity to make a voluntary disclosure to the Revenue Commissioners when requested so to do;</font> </p>

             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Submissions on behalf of the applicant</font></b>
             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">25. The applicant submits that the sentencing judge erred in relying on alleged delays as being a relevant factor and submitted that there was no culpable delay on the part of the prosecution. The adjournments that took place from the time of the return for trial occurred as a result of requests on the part of the respondents.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">26. Additionally, the applicant submits that the judge failed to take sufficient account of the level of deliberation and calculation involved. Specifically, the respondents had: deliberately and persistently failed to keep till records; eliminated the reading facility which would have enabled the amount of monies cashed into the till to be identified; and paid substantial sums of VAT into their personal bank accounts. While the applicant does concede that the respondents may have been ill-suited to running a business, it was submitted that that cannot account for the intentional discarding of records or tampering with the recording system. Further, while the trial judge acknowledged that the respondents failed to make a voluntary disclosure, he did not identify this as an aggravating factor.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27. The applicant submits that there was a clear error in principle, in failing to clearly identify all aggravating factors and in misidentifying delay as a mitigating factor. The judge further erred in failing to identify where on the scale of offending the respondents&#x2019; offence ought to be located. The Director therefore submits that the suspension of the entirety of the sentence was unwarranted.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">28. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Begley</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2013] IECCA 32, the importance of incentivising cooperation was highlighted. In that case, the applicant supplied documentation </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;chapter and verse.&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> In the present case, the respondents merely supplied a box of documents. Further, the disabling of the recording system and the destruction of receipts must be viewed as a significant aggravating factor.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">29. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Begley</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the applicant in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Hughes</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2012] IECCA 85 was</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;grossly non-compliant.&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Here, the applicants submit that not only were the respondents grossly non-compliant, but the respondents took </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;active and deliberate steps toward concealing income&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. Their wrongdoing involved elements of premeditated commission, not mere omission. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Berry</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2009] IECCA 161, Hardiman J. found that the applicant&#x2019;s scheme was &#x201c;not a very clever scheme&#x201d; and that records had been reasonably well kept. In that case, having regard to the applicant&#x2019;s good character, the Court held that there had been an error in principle. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Campbell</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2014] IECA 15 the jurisprudence relating to revenue cases was comprehensively reviewed. The appropriate headline sentence should first be assessed having regard to the gravity of the case against which the mitigating factors should then be discounted. While the applicants acknowledge that sentencing does not involve the application of mechanistic formulae, the sentencing judge failed to assess the gravity of the matter and having regard to the particular aggravating factors, this amounts to an error in principle.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">30. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Begley</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the Court of Criminal Appeal advocated against a </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;blanket approach&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in tax fraud cases. Hence, the applicant submits, and having regard to the acknowledged variation permissible in such cases, there is in fact a greater onus on the sentencing judge to identify where the offending lies in terms of its gravity having regard to aggravating factors. By way of further support for this contention the applicant draws attention to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Richard Molloy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IECA 239 in which this Court emphasised the importance of a sentencing judge making a proper assessment of the gravity of a case. In particular, the applicant relies on the Court&#x2019;s emphasis on there having been a positive mens rea, the existence of planning and premeditation and the existence of profit, as well as the economic consequences (in that case, counterfeiting currency). The applicant submits that all of these considerations are applicable to the present case, but were not considered by the sentencing judge.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Submissions on behalf of the first named respondent</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">31. The respondent relies on the judgment of McKechnie J. in the Court of Criminal Appeal in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Begley</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2013] 2 IR 188, who, while advocating against a </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;blanket approach&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, identified a number of factors that the Court should consider in cases of tax fraud. These are: the fact of some restitution or something of that nature having been made; the fact that in a great many revenue cases no criminal prosecutions occur, and instead are dealt with through civil proceeding to which attach monetary penalties and the mobilisation of shame through the media; the fact that admissions and pleas are crucial to the prosecution of white collar crime; and finally, the fact that incentivising cooperation must always be kept in mind. The respondent submits that all these factors apply to the instant case.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">32. The respondent further points out that for this Court to intervene in the learned sentencing Judge&#x2019;s sentence, there must be a clear error in principle. This, he submits, has not occurred. It is clear from </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Begley</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Campbell</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, that each case must be treated on its own special facts, and the respondent argues that the sentencing Judge exercised his discretion on the basis of a deep understanding of the complexity of the issues which should not be underestimated or lightly disturbed.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">33. The respondent further submits that on a review of the recent authorities, the sentence of three years imposed in the present case is </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;very substantial&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in circumstances where an early plea of guilty was entered and the maximum sentence was five years. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Campbell</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, a sentence of 12 months was imposed for a sum in excess of &#x20ac;1 million in circumstances where bank statements were deliberately altered. Meanwhile in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Begley</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, a sentence of two years was imposed in circumstances where the product sold was misstated and there was a sum of &#x20ac;700,000 outstanding. The first respondent submits that the applicant&#x2019;s objection to the process by which the sentence was arrived at is </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;almost moot and somewhat artificial&#x201d; </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">in circumstances where it is unlikely a longer sentence could have been arrived at by an alternative process.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">34. As is well established, the issue of a suspended sentence is entirely distinct from the passing of a custodial sentence. The decision to issue a suspended sentence must take place only after a headline custodial sentence has been decided, as accepted in this jurisdiction in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Loving</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2006] 3 IR 355. The first respondent submits that his personal circumstances are such that a suspended sentence was entirely warranted. These circumstances include: the payment of &#x20ac;35,000, which is at the limit of what the respondent can afford; the publicity and shame attached; financial consequences in relation monies borrowed and the fact his home is in negative equity and payments on that loan are in arrears, on foot of which the bank is threatening action; the fact that the respondents were not suited to running a business; the fact that the respondents were not wealthy; the fact that the first respondent has a partner and very young child who he supports with a modest income; and the fact that he has no other previous convictions. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">35. Finally, the respondent responds to a number of alleged aggravating factors which the DPP submits were not appropriately considered by the learned sentencing Judge. In relation to the alleged failure to consider the fact that the respondents deposited money into their personal accounts, the first respondent submits that in evidence, it emerged that the situation was more complicated than that. In fact, there were three accounts, one in the name of the company and one in the name of each of the respondents. It is unfair, the first respondent submits, to say that substantial sums due to Revenue were lodged to priv
