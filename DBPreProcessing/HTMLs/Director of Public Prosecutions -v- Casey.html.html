             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of the Court delivered on the 27th day of February 2017 by Mr. Justice Hedigan </font></b> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Introduction</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This is an appeal brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the basis that the sentence imposed upon the respondent in respect of a charge of robbery by the learned trial judge was unduly lenient. The respondent was sentenced, having contested the charge, on the 12th February, 2016, in respect of the offence, to three years which was suspended in full for a period of six years subject to certain conditions. This sentence was consecutive to a sentence of three years and six months imposed for an earlier robbery.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The indictment contained five counts. The respondent was convicted by a jury on counts one and two. These, respectively, were the robbery of €15 cash and burglary of an inhabited caravan. The respondent had earlier pleaded guilty to counts four and five. These were possession of a knife at the time of the robbery and criminal damage in a Garda station. This application is not directed at the burglary or criminal damage sentencing. It focuses on the robbery conviction alone. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Circumstances of the Offences</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. At 8pm on the 21st March, 2015, one Edward Quinlivan, who was 16 years old, was walking with two friends when he was approached by the respondent. The respondent said he had a knife and demanded money. Mr. Quinlivan having been put in fear handed him €15. The respondent advised one of the two companions not to call the Gardai. The Gardai were in fact informed and located him. On being searched he was found in possession of €15, a Stanley knife with a retractable blade and a ladies ring which was stolen from the inhabited caravan.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The respondent was questioned on the 21st and 22nd March, 2015. He denied having contact with the injured party or his companions. He stated the knife was for cutting lino. Later he said that he was unaware of it, that the jacket was borrowed and the knife must have been in the pocket.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. At the time that the offences were committed the respondent was on bail in respect of two earlier offences. The first of these was the above robbery in which the handbag was stolen from a woman who was six months pregnant. She suffered a minor cut to her finger. This was a random and opportunistic offence. It was committed while he was on bail for yet another second offence. This was a charge of possession of a weapon. It arose from an incident where the Gardai intercepted a vehicle containing the respondent and eight other armed men. They were described by the judge as “a lynch mob”. The respondent was in possession of a pick axe handle. This was an orchestrated incident but the respondent was not one of the principal offenders. The respondent pleaded guilty at an early stage to both these offences. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Respondent’s Personal Circumstances</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The respondent has a number of previous convictions which relate to offences relatively minor in nature compared to those mentioned above. The respondent’s mother died in a road traffic accident and his father died in violent circumstances. He was an orphan at the age of 17 months. He did not have the support of caring parents during his formative years. He has also suffered further recent tragic bereavements. He has addiction issues which he is attempting to address. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. In a letter sent on the 27th May, 2015, there is a general expression of apology, although this could not be said to extend to the contested charge. It also included statements about his intention to address his addictions and refers to the recent death of his brother. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sentence</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">8. The learned trial judge dealt with all the offences before him as follows;</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In relation to count one of Bill No. 72/2015 with which we are concerned herein, he found the aggravating factors were that the offence was opportunistic, menacing and intimidating. It was committed while the accused was on bail for two other charges including one of robbery. No remorse was expressed. In mitigation the judge found that there was no actual violence, there was an early plea albeit to only two of the charges and the accused had a difficult and tragic family background. He sentenced the accused on count one, the robbery, to three years consecutive to concurrent sentences of three years and six months imposed in respect of the other offences of robbery and possession of a weapon. The judge suspended the sentence in full for a period of six years from the date of the sentence. In respect of count two, that was taken into consideration. No order was made in respect of count three. In respect of count four a sentence of twelve months was imposed concurrent with the sentence in respect of count one and suspended on the same terms. Count five was taken into consideration. The accused having been in custody since the 28th April, 2015, the sentence was backdated to that date. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Appellant’s Submissions</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">9. It was the appellant’s submission that the sentence imposed failed to reflect a significant aggravating factor, namely, the commission of an offence involving violence or the threat of violence when on bail in respect of similar offences. The respondent did not have the benefit in mitigation of a guilty plea. He had been convicted by a jury following a trial.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The appellant refers to s. 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 as amended by s. 10 of the Bail Act 1997 and as substituted in part by the Criminal Justice Act 2007 and submitted that in most cases where an offence is committed while an offender is on bail two consequences automatically follow:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">i. It is mandatory to make any sentences imposed consecutive to the sentence for the offence in respect of which he was on bail.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ii. Offending while on bail must be treated as a separate aggravating factor unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying departing therefrom.</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">11. It was submitted that this Court and its predecessor have repeatedly emphasised the importance of observing those statutory provisions. The Court was referred to </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Doran</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2008] IECCA 78 at p. 3 which noted the requirement for consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail and that s. 10 of the Bail Act 1997 states that it is an aggravating factor. Further where the offences are very similar one could expect an increasing scale of imprisonment. The overall time to be spent in prison should be looked at having regard to the offences involved.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. The appellant noted that the methodology for applying the provisions of s. 11 of the 1984 Act have been set out in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Yusuf</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2008] I.R. 204 and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Healy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IECA 3.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. The appellant referred to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. O’Leary</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] IECA 128 where it was noted that robberies accompanied by a weapon or the threat of violence invariably result in custodial sentences. With strong mitigation this might be part custodial part suspended. Every case is different and regard should be had to the crime and the criminal.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. The appellant noted the following aggravating factors:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">i. The victim was 16 years old.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ii. While the victim did not see the knife in the respondent’s possession the respondent threatened him with the weapon.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">iii. An attempt was made to dissuade him from calling the Gardai.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">iv. It was an offence committed while on bail for a similar random, opportunistic robbery of a vulnerable victim.</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">15. It was submitted that the sentencing judge failed to reflect these factors in identifying the appropriate headline starting point. Significant mitigation was not available to the sentencing judge and he correctly stated that there was no evidence of remorse.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. It was submitted that only in exceptional circumstances should a sentence which must be consecutive due to being committed while on bail be suspended in its entirety. The suspended sentence constituted a substantial departure from the appropriate punishment. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Respondent’s Submissions</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">17. The respondent submitted that the sentencing judge in light of the respondent’s “very, very difficult family circumstances” imposed a sentence of three years and six months on the first robbery and a consecutive three year sentence on the second fully suspended for six years. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. The respondent referred </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">to The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Clohessy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IECA 356 at para. 13 and submitted that the sentencing principles are particularly apposite for the respondent. The Court in that case noted that the suspended sentence “is nevertheless a punishment in that it remains capable of activation” and such applications often arise. The sentence would “hang over the respondent” and that he remained “under the watchful eye of the justice system for up to six years, and in a manner which will incentivise rehabilitation”.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. The respondent also referred to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Ellis</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IECA 358 where this Court at para. 20 approved and quoted O’Malley, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sentencing Law and Practice</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, 2nd Edition, (Dublin, 2006) para. 6.51 on the last chance principle. The author noted that there is some authority for the approach of giving offenders with a criminal record, and perhaps a lengthy one, a last chance if there are indications that they intend to relinquish the criminal way of life.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. The sentencing judge having already imposed a lengthy custodial sentence for the first robbery carefully constructed the consecutive sentence to take account of the respondent’s personal circumstances. He was afforded a real prospect of rehabilitation upon completion of the first sentence with the probability of having the suspended sentence activated if he did not take the opportunity.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21. The lack of an expression of remorse was accepted but it was submitted that to have offered remorse having contested the robbery and burglary charges would have been an empty gesture. The respondent expressed general remorse in his letter of the 27th May, 2015, which the sentencing judge considered.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22. There were substantial points of mitigation which supported the suspended consecutive sentence and it was not a substantial departure from what would be regarded as an appropriate sentence. It was within the sentencing judge’s discretion and margin of appreciation. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decision</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">23. This appeal is focussed upon the sentence imposed in respect of count one of Bill No. 72/2015 which was one of three years consecutive to concurrent sentences of three years and six months and twelve months in respect of Bills No. 1/2015 and 3/2015 respectively. The learned trial judge suspended this sentence in full for a period of six years from the sentence date subject to certain conditions.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">24. The accused committed the instant offence at a time when he was on bail for the offences referred to in Bills No. 1/2015 and 3/2015. This offence was the robbery of €15 from a youth who was accompanied by two other youths. The accused told his victim that he had a knife and demanded money. In sentencing him the learned trial judge considered the offence to be opportunistic, menacing and intimidatory. He noted no remorse was expressed albeit it was said on behalf of the accused that this would have been rather futile in the context of his having contested the robbery charge involved here. Although the knife was not produced during the robbery, it was a clear and present threat to a victim who was of a nervous disposition. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">25. This Court considers that it is of first importance that full account be taken of the clear legislative policy expressed in s. 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (as amended by s. 10 of the Bail Act 1997) and substituted in part by the Criminal Justice Act 2007. This provides as follows:-</font> </p>

              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">"(1) Any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence— </font></i>
