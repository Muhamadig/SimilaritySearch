             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This is an appeal by the Minister for Justice and Equality, the applicant/appellant, who is referred to as &#x201c;the Minister&#x201d;, from the judgment of the High Court (Edwards J.) delivered on the 28th November, 2013, which refused to surrender Ferenc Horvath, the respondent, referred to as &#x201c;the respondent&#x201d;, to Hungary.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Certificate</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">2. On the application of the Minister, the learned High Court judge certified that the said judgment involved a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it was desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken from the said judgment on the following point:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> Whether the High Court was correct in law in its decision that the surrender of the respondent to Hungary for the purposes of a second instance prosecution fell within the scope of an application of s. 45 of the European Arrest Warrant Act of 2003, as amended, (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;the Act of 2003&#x201d;).</font>

             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The Minister raised the following grounds of appeal:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) The learned trial judge erred in law in his conclusion that the surrender of the respondent was prohibited by s. 45 of the Act of 2003.</font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) The learned trial judge accepted that the surrender of the respondent to Hungary was sought for the purposes of prosecution and that the respondent was presumed innocent. Notwithstanding these findings, the learned trial judge held that an undertaking was required by s. 45 of the Act of 2003.</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) The learned trial judge erred in fact in finding that the respondent was a convicted person, in Hungarian law, such that an undertaking was required by s. 45 of the Act of 2003.</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) The learned trial judge erred in law in finding that an undertaking was required by s. 45 of the Act of 2003.</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v) The findings of the learned trial judge was against the weight of the evidence.</font></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The respondent took no issue on the relevant facts as set out in paragraphs 1.1 to 1.8 of the Minister&#x2019;s submission. Thus, I gratefully adopt the said description, being as follows:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;1.1 A European arrest warrant dated 27th May 2010 was transmitted to the State on 16th December 2010 and was endorsed on 18th May 2011 after the receipt of additional information dated 11th May 2011. The offences for which the respondent is sought involve corruption in the respondent&#x2019;s capacity as a police officer. This warrant was executed on 20th October 2011 and is the subject of these proceedings.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 1.2 The warrant the subject of the proceedings is the third warrant issued and transmitted to the State in respect of the respondent. The first warrant was issued on 12th June 2007 and endorsed by the High Court on 5th September 2007. Peart J. directed the surrender of the respondent in respect of 13 offences by Order dated 25th November 2008, and refused to direct the surrender of the respondent in respect of four offences by Order dated 19th December 2008. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 1.3 After the hearing of the appeal against surrender on the first warrant, but before delivery of judgment by the Supreme Court, a second warrant was received in the State. Upon application on behalf of the Central Authority, the Supreme Court vacated the orders endorsing the first warrant and directing the surrender of the respondent. In those circumstances, judgment of the Supreme Court which had been reserved was not delivered. The second warrant was not endorsed by the High Court. The third warrant was endorsed on 18th May 2011, together with additional information dated 11th May 2011. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 1.4 The issuing judicial authority issued the third warrant, which is described in the additional information dated 16th December 2010 as &#x201c;a corrected warrant&#x201d;. It is stated therein that the respondent is sought &#x201c;for criminal proceedings and not for enforcement of a sentence&#x201d;. It is further explained that he is sought for the purposes of an appeal or &#x201c;second instance&#x201d; criminal proceeding. This was reiterated in the additional information dated 11th May 2011, which states :</font> </p>
               <ul>
                <br> 
                <font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c; - the named person was convicted at first instance and that a sentence of 3 years and 6 months was imposed on him;</font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> - the named person is now sought for the purposes of prosecution and not to serve the above sentence imposed on him at first instance;</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> - the named person is now sought for the purposes of an appeal hearing and this appeal is a full hearing of the case.&#x201d;</font></p>
               </ul> 
               <br> 
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> 1.5 It is common case that there was a first instance trial and that the respondent was found guilty and a sentence imposed and that he was not present at that time. It is also common case that the respondent did not have actual notice of the first instance trial in advance thereof. Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent (but not appointed by him) appealed against the first instance decision. The issuing judicial authority clearly states that the first instance decision is not final or executable and that the respondent is sought for criminal proceedings or prosecution at second instance. In the additional information dated 8th August 2013, it is stated that the respondent is regarded as a defendant and that he has the benefit of the presumption of innocence. While the affidavit of Magyar Gabor, of 12th July 2012, states that the third warrant purports to be for the purposes of prosecution, the statement of the issuing judicial authority to that effect is not disputed on behalf of the respondent by Mr. Gabor. </font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 1.6 By Order made the 28th November 2013 Edwards J. refused to direct the surrender of the respondent to Hungary on the ground that section 45, European Arrest Warrant Act, 2003, applied to the request for surrender and no undertaking for a retrial had been provided by the Hungarian Authorities.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 1.7 It was held by Edwards J. that the respondent was sought for prosecution, and not to serve a custodial sentence or detention order which had been imposed on him. </font> </p>

Indeed, it might well be that a correct interpretation would lead to the exclusion of an individual from the benefit of a national measure, once it was correctly interpreted as a matter of European Union law. Accordingly, I am satisfied that section 44 must be interpreted in conformity with article 4.7(b) and not merely with the general objectives of the Framework Decision.&#x201d;</font>

             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">13. The High Court applied s. 45 of the Act of 2003, without including the amendment of 2012.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. It was accepted in the High Court at that time that an amendment effected cases where the European arrest warrant was endorsed </font><u><font size="2" face="Verdana">after</font></u><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the commencement of the amendment. Consequently, where a warrant was endorsed </font><u><font size="2" face="Verdana">prior</font></u><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the commencement of an amendment coming into force, the older version of the law applied.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. That is what happened in this case. The pre 2012 version of s. 45 was applied in the High Court. The High Court judgment was not decided after any legal argument on the newer version of s. 45, rather it was decided on the basis of the pre 2012 law. The issue of the amendment of 2012 was not raised in the certified question. Nor may it be found in the grounds of appeal.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. The appellant sought in this Court to argue a point not argued in, nor determined by, nor certified by, the High Court, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the application of the amendment in the 2012 Act to this case.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jurisdiction of Supreme Court</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">17. The Supreme Court is an appellate court. In general it does not hear issues which have not been argued before, and determined by, the High Court. There are a very few exceptions to this jurisprudence, none of which apply in this case.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. This jurisprudence has been explained repeatedly by the Court. As I stated in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Blehein v. Murphy </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2000] 2 I.R. 231:-</font> </p>

               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;Parties, including the Attorney General, have the right to have the issues argued fully in the High Court. Issues may be reargued on appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal in Ireland and most of its jurisdiction is appellate. To this there are a few exceptions. In exceptional circumstances the Supreme Court will consider issues of constitutional law which have not been argued in the High Court.&#x201d; </font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">19. No exceptional circumstances arise in the case. Thus, I would not hear an appeal on a ground not argued in the High Court, not certified by the High Court, and not appearing on the grounds of appeal set out in the notice of appeal by the Minister.</font>

             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jurisprudence of this Court</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">26. I ground my decision on this issue on the long established jurisprudence of this Court that parties have the right to have issues fully argued in the High Court before they are reargued on appeal in this appellate Court. This principle applies except in the very exceptional circumstances. I am satisfied that no such exceptional circumstances apply in this case.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27. Thus, it is not open to the Minister to argue on this appeal the application of the terms of s. 45 as amended by the Act of 2012.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">28. In addition, this appeal came to the Court, not by way of a general right of appeal, but pursuant to a specific process by which the High Court certified a point of law of exceptional public importance.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">29. The point of law of exceptional public importance, upon which the Minister applied successfully to the High Court to certify to this Court, is set out in paragraph 2 above in this judgment. It does not include the issue of the application of s. 45 as amended by the Act of 2012. Thus, while the High Court gave leave for a point of law of exceptional public importance to be argued in this Court, the point which the Minister now raises was not certified by the High Court.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">30. On this point, I would dismiss the appeal.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Section 45 of the European Arrest Warrant Act, 2003</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">31. The terms of s. 45 of the European Arrest Warrant Act, 2003, prior to 2012, have been set out previously in this judgment. In interpreting the words of the section I would give them their plain and ordinary meaning.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">32. The Minister referred to Article 5 of the Framework Decision and argued, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, that the section should apply only where the stated purpose of the European arrest warrant was for the surrender of a person post conviction. It was argued, applying the principle of conforming interpretation, that as the trial </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">in absentia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> provisions of the Framework Decision are prefaced by the words &#x201c;where the European arrest warrant has been issued for the purposes of executing a sentence or detention order&#x201d;, these words should be read into s. 45.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">33. I have referred to the principle of conforming interpretation earlier in this judgment.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">34. The principle of conforming legislation has been followed in this Court on many occasions, applying the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pupino</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Case C &#x2013; 105/03) [2005] E.C.R. 1 &#x2013; 05285.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">35. However, while applying the principle it has also been recognised that the principle cannot be a basis for interpreting national law </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">contra legem</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">36. The learned High Court judge took great care in coming to a conclusion on this issue. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He held:-</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;Counsel for the respondent makes a very simple point in relation to section 45, and it is this. He contends that there is nothing in the wording of s. 45 (i.e. s. 45 in the form that it was enacted prior to the 2012 amendment) to confine its application to cases where surrender is being sought for the execution of a sentence. The Court was not initially persuaded by this argument, and was inclined to accept the submission of counsel for the applicant that s. 45 has simply no application where a respondent is wanted for prosecution. If that had remained the position it would have been the intention of the Court to surrender the respondent. Indeed, conscious that Mr. Horváth was waiting a long time to know his fate the Court indicated late last week that it had decided to surrender him and stated that it would furnish its reasons in the written judgment that it was then finalising on Tuesday of this week. However, while the matter was &#x201c;in the breast of the Court&#x201d; to quote from the jurisprudence, the Court has had a change of mind as a result of further reviewing the evidence and the authorities and some further reflection on the complex issues thrown up by this case. The position is that the Court is now disposed to uphold the s. 45 objection having come to view that the submission of counsel for the respondent is in fact correct.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Notwithstanding its change of mind the Court was in any event satisfied, and remains satisfied, that because the respondent is wanted for second instance trial, and not to serve a sentence, it is correct to say that he is wanted for prosecution.&#x201d;</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">37. The learned trial judge distinguished, correctly in my view, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform v. Mayer (Unreported, 30th July, 2010, High Court, Peart J.)</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">38. The High Court considered article 5(1) of the Framework Decision and s. 45 (pre 2012) and held:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;The first thing to be said is that the fact that article 5(1) of the Framework Decision is expressed differently to s. 45 does not assist in circumstances where the Framework Decision is not directly effective, and the domestic statutory provision appears clear and unambiguous in its terms. The Court cannot resort to trying to give it a conforming interpretation where the provision is clear on its face and there is nothing to suggest that a literal interpretation would fail to give effect to the intention of the Oireachtas. While article 5(1) envisages that conditions might be imposed before a person who had been tried </font>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">in absentia</font></i>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> is surrendered it is confined to cases where the warrant seeking that person&#x2019;s surrender &#x201c;has been issued for the purposes of executing a sentence or a detention order&#x201d;, s. 45 contains no such limitation and there is nothing in the provision considered either alone, or in the context of the Act of 2003 as a whole, to suggest that Oireachtas intended other than to impose more extensive conditionality than that envisaged by the Framework Decision.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">39. It is not contested that the respondent was tried in his absence, and was not notified of the trial. Thus, </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">, s. 45 is applicable to him as he was tried and convicted when he was not present, and had not been notified of the time and place of this trial. The wording of s. 45 is clear. I agree with the analysis of the High Court as set out above.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">40. Further, the High Court considered the fact that the respondent would have an appeal. In analysing the respondent&#x2019;s status in such a situation the learned High Court judge held:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;It is clear to this Court that the [respondent&#x2019;s] task is to persuade the court of second instance, if he can, that his conviction was wrong. However, it is also clear to me that he does not come into Court as an unconvicted person. He remains convicted, albeit not conclusively, and it is simply the case that the decision of the court below is effectively stayed pending ratification or overruling, as the case may be, by the court of second instance.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">41. The learned trial judge pointed out that the status of conviction has important implications under s. 45. He was satisfied that the condition in s. 45(a) was fulfilled and also one of the conditions in s. 45(b), and that thus surrender could not take place without an undertaking in writing being provided by the issuing judicial authority.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">42. In this case the Hungarian authorities have stated that no undertaking would be provided. Consequently, the learned trial judge considered that he had no choice but to uphold the s. 45 objection, and to refuse to surrender the respondent.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">43. The High Court concluded that as there was not an undertaking in the form required by s. 45, it must refuse to make an order of surrender, and to discharge the respondent from his bail.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">44. I am satisfied that there was an evidential and legal basis upon which the learned trial judge could reach this conclusion. I would affirm his decision that an undertaking for a re-trial was required by section 45, in its unamended form.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">45. I am satisfied that the High Court was correct in its determination of the case on the law as it was prior to the amendment in 2012. I make no decision on the issue as to whether the applicable law was that as stated prior to the 2012 amendment, or whether the applicable law was that as stated in the amendment of 2012.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">46. Consequently, on this point also, I would dismiss the appeal.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cross Appeal</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">47. The respondent brought a cross appeal from that part of the judgment and order of the High Court as decided that the surrender of the respondent to Hungary for the purposes of a second instance prosecution was not a breach of his rights as guaranteed by Article 2 of the 7th Protocol of the European Convention of Human Rights and/or s. 37 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, as amended. However, as a consequence of my decision on the appeal brought by the Minister, it is not necessary to consider the cross-appeal.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Remit</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">48. In all the circumstances, this is not an appropriate case to remit to the High Court. For, amongst other factors, the matter has now been before the courts for a long time.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Conclusion</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">49. There was no right of general appeal to this Court from the decision of the High Court in this case. On application by the Minister to the High Court, the High Court certified a point of law of exceptional public importance. The Minister has sought to raise another issue. However, in accordance with the well established jurisprudence of this Court, such other issue may not be advanced in this Court, much less determined.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">50. As the High Court decided the case by reference to the un-amended s. 45, and counsel for the Minister now argue that the amended version of s. 45 applies, a situation has arisen where the Minister wishes to argue a ground which was not argued in the High Court. It is not in accordance with the jurisprudence of this Court to consider an appeal on issues not argued in the High Court, and further which were not part of the certificate providing for appeal to this Court, and nor were identified in the grounds of appeal.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">51. On the issue of the application of s. 45 of the European Arrest Warrant Act, 2003, as amended, (prior to 2012) I would affirm the decision of the High Court that the surrender of the respondent was prohibited in the absence of an undertaking as required by section 45.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">52. Consequently, for the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal.</font><br> </p>
