             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of the Court delivered on the 6th day of April 2017 by</font></b> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. Justice Hedigan </font></b> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Introduction</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the basis that the sentence imposed was unduly lenient. The respondent entered a guilty plea to the offence of assault causing harm contrary to s. 3 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 on the 11th December, 2015. The respondent was sentenced by His Honour Judge John Aylmer in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on the 24th February, 2016, to 18 months imprisonment suspended for 18 months. There was also a charge of assault causing serious harm contrary to s. 4 for which a </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">nolle prosequi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was entered. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The suspension was on the following conditions. The respondent enter into a bond of &#x20ac;100, keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of 18 months and pay to the victim, within four weeks, compensation of &#x20ac;8,000.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Circumstances of the Offence</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. In the early hours of the morning on the 20th July, 2014, in the Palace Night-club the respondent struck Mr. Brian Murphy in the face with a pint glass. It was disputed whether the victim was acting in an &#x201c;annoying&#x201d; manner and making provocative gestures towards the respondent. The injured party denied this but two of the prosecution&#x2019;s civilian witnesses said there had been prior interaction between the parties.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The glass hit the victim around his left eye. He was taken to St. James&#x2019;s Hospital for emergency treatment. The incident and injury resulted in scarring, permanent loss of vision in his left eye and psychological trauma. He underwent five operations under general anaesthesia.</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">He will need at least one more. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. A victim impact statement was read to the Court. It included details of the devastating impact the injury had on the victim who was studying medicine at the time. An updated victim impact statement has been handed into Court. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The respondent remained at the scene and was cautioned, arrested and taken to Kevin Street Garda Station. He admitted to striking the victim. He made admissions both at the scene and at the Garda Station answering all questions put to him. He stated that the injured party &#x201c;came close, he made the cut gesture again, that&#x2019;s when I instinctively threw my right hand at him, I was completely unaware that I was holding a pint glass at that moment, and after that&#x2019;s it&#x2019;s quite a blur, rush of adrenalin&#x201d;. The respondent expressed remorse to the injured party several times.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Respondent&#x2019;s Personal Circumstances</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">7. At the time of the incident the respondent was 25 years old with no previous convictions. He had a degree in business and was working in a bank and taking banking exams. He worked from the age of 16 and put himself through college where he achieved a first class honours degree. He had &#x20ac;8,000 compensation with him at the sentencing hearing. At the time he was in a relationship and they were expecting a child in July, 2016. He has since had the baby. As a consequence of his conviction he no longer works in the same employment but has found work in another similar post. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sentence</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">8. In sentencing the learned judge described this as a very serious offence on the upper end of the scale of s. 3 offences. The injuries were described as &#x201c;horrific&#x201d;. The mitigating factors identified were the respondent&#x2019;s previously impeccable character with no previous convictions. He had never come to Garda attention and was never likely to. The assault was without premeditation. The respondent was given the benefit of the doubt in relation to provocation. There was no need for rehabilitation as there is no likelihood of reoffending. It was noted that there was an offer of compensation to be made from the savings of the respondent and his partner. It was noted that if allowed to pursue his career the respondent would remain available to provide further compensation. A custodial sentence would be likely to destroy his career prospects and this would affect the injured party&#x2019;s ability to recover compensation.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Appellant&#x2019;s Submissions</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">9. It was the appellant&#x2019;s submission that the sentencing judge erred in reducing the offence from the upper end of the scale and imposing a sentence at the lower end. There was a grave level of violence. The sentence was unduly lenient given the serious injuries and the use of a weapon.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. While the sentencing judge identified the appropriate mitigation tendered he gave too much weight to it given the serious nature of the assault. The wholly suspended sentence was inappropriate where the offence had been deemed to be at the upper end of the scale. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. The sentence did not reflect the serious nature of the assault with a weapon and there was no element of deterrence to others. The Court was referred to the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (DPP) v. Lyons</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2014] IECCA 27 at para. 40 where it was noted that even though personal deterrence was not a significant factor there should be an element of deterrence to others. It would send the wrong message to society if this was not reflected in the custodial element and totality of punishment. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. It was submitted that there was a failure to regard and reflect in the sentence the full extent of the trauma and lasting effects as outlined in the victim impact statement and medical reports.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. There was a failure to appropriately consider the level of violence which should have attracted a custodial sentence. The use of a glass to strike the injured party&#x2019;s face was an aggravating factor that was not given proper consideration during sentencing.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. Undue weight was given to the guilty plea. There was very strong evidence against the respondent. It is accepted however that a guilty plea is always positive mitigation.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. It was submitted that it was not proper to consider the effect of a custodial sentence on the respondent&#x2019;s ability to pay compensation. The Court was referred to O&#x2019;Malley, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sentencing Law and Practice</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, 3rd Ed., (Dublin, 2016) at para. 27-11 where the author states that the payment of compensation in the case of a serious offence should not save a person from imprisonment.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. The pending civil action was not a matter that should have been taken into consideration. The Court was referred to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lyons</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at para. 63 where it was held to be a separate liability that is not a factor in sentencing. The payment of compensation should not automatically be a factor in mitigation.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Respondent&#x2019;s Submissions</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">17. The judge must consider the aggravating and mitigating factors and sentence the individual offender based on the facts and their personal circumstances as held in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (AG) v. O&#x2019;Driscoll</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1972] 1 Frewen 351 at 359. The respondent submitted that the mitigating factors were, in addition to those listed above, the guilty plea, that the respondent remained at the scene, made admissions, expressed remorse and wrote an apology letter. He stated he felt threatened. In his Garda interview he expanded and clarified the account he gave at the scene, he answered all questions and cooperated. He had worked to put himself through college where he did well and secured gainful employment, he was now the father of a newborn baby with his partner and there were testimonials speaking to his character.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. The Court was referred to O&#x2019;Malley where the author referenced a decision from the Supreme Court of South Australia where it was noted that the appropriate sentence is within a range and that sentencing is not a precise process. It was submitted that the sentencing court was entitled to identify the offence as at the upper end of the scale but also entitled to give maximum weight to the mitigating factors. There has been no issue raised about the quality of the mitigation. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. It was submitted that the appellant&#x2019;s submission that undue weight was given to the respondent&#x2019;s guilty plea was unfounded. The Court dealt with it as a matter of fact not mitigation. It was not mentioned in the mitigating factors listed. The respondent could complain that the sentencing judge failed to afford credit for it. Further it was the respondent&#x2019;s actions after the assault which left him with little scope for a defence. He bolstered the prosecution&#x2019;s case. His admissions put identity beyond doubt, he was not known to the injured party, whose sight was affected in the assault and CCTV did not feature. The Court was referred to the comments on guilty pleas where the offender has provided most of the information for the case against him in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (DPP) v. Begley</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2013] 2 I.R. 188 at 212. It was noted that it must be given serious consideration. Further even when caught red handed a guilty plea represents a mitigating factor as noted in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (DPP) v. Cully</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2014] IECA 41 at para. 5.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. The respondent noted the factors which were considered in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (DPP) v. McCabe </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2005] IECCA 79. These included his being lead to believe a non-custodial sentence would be imposed and that it was hanging over him for almost 3 years. The Court considered that the time elapsed between the offence and final decision on appeal in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (DPP) v. C(J)</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2014] IECA 1 and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (DPP) v. Farrell</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2010] IECCA 116 was a factor in refusing to interfere with the sentence imposed as it would be unjust in the circumstances.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21. It was submitted that the respondent is entitled to expect that the sentence imposed is that which he will have to abide by. This is consistent with the rule of finality. To interfere would cause hardship particularly if a custodial sentence replaced a non-custodial sentence. The courts have recognised this hardship and it was considered in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (DPP) v. Ryan and Rooney </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2015] IECA 2 at para. 30. In that case it was noted that the respondents had been at liberty but were then coming to be imprisoned. The Court recognised the additional disappointment following an extra period of anxiety and that it was recognised that this was a stressful experience that might justify some leniency. Moreover, other countries have reduced the new term of imprisonment in recognition of this. There was also a considerable amount of time since sentencing. The Court held that some significant allowance should be made for these factors.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decision</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">22. There is no doubt but that the events during the night of 20th July, 2014 have had consequences that will live with the respondent and the victim for the rest of their lives. The victim, Brian Murphy, has not only suffered the catastrophic loss of his vision in one eye.</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">He has had to endure five operations on his eye and will have another at some later stage.</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">He will go through life with the ever present danger that any injury to his remaining eye will result in complete blindness. He has however pulled his life together admirably and has resumed his medical studies in Trinity College, Dublin albeit with some considerable difficulty. For him and for his family this incident has had devastating and life changing consequences. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">23. For the respondent Robert Jones, the consequences have been considerably less devastating.</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">They have however impacted upon him largely through the criminal process. From being a hard working, successful young man who had educated himself to a first class degree, good employment, marriage and the birth recently of a first child, he now finds himself at the hazard of a prison sentence. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">24. Almost invariably in cases of violence such as herein, the Courts should impose a sentence however mitigated that contains at least some element of custody. There have however been exceptions to this. A good example may be found in the decision of this Court dated 23rd March, 2017 </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (DPP) v. Ann Marie Byrne</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. The judgment at paras. 26 and 27 considers the normal approach to sentencing as a two stage process, firstly determining the gravity of the offence and secondly discounting from the headline sentence for any mitigating factors that may be found. The Court went on to state at para. 28 as follows:&#x2014;</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;However, that fairly simplistic explanation of the process may represent less than the full picture in that subset of cases where a sentencing judge finds it appropriate to consider the possible suspension of the entirety of a nominated headline sentence. In that situation a subsidiary issue arises for consideration within the second stage of the overall process, namely whether the suspension of the entirety of the sentence could be appropriate at all in the circumstances of the case, and some issues already considered in the first stage may again become relevant in the context of that subsidiary issue.&#x201d;</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">25. And later the Court continued at para. 33:&#x2014;</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The offence in this case was subject to discretionary punishment. However, we recognise that some offences will be so serious that they effectively carry a presumption against the suspension of a custodial sentence in its entirety. That is certainly true in the case of rape offences, s.15A drugs offences, certain firearms offences and egregious crimes of violence. However, even in such cases existing jurisprudence indicates that a wholly suspended sentence can be imposed in cases where there are special reasons of a substantial nature and particularly exceptional circumstances. Examples are to be found in The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. McGinty [2006] IECCA 37; The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Alexiou [2003] 3 I.R. 513; The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Jervis and Doyle [2014] IECCA 14 and The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v.
