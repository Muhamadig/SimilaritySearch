              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The child came to the attention of social services in another Member State when the mother sought advice from a charity there about protection from alleged domestic abuse. The charity notified social services about the allegation and the risk to the child by reason of domestic violence. Prior to this the child was not known to social services. Social Services supported the mother. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In September 2014 the father was convicted of harassing the mother. The Courts of the Member State also granted an unlimited Restraining Order against the father to protect the mother and he was restrained from contacting or attempting to contact the mother directly or indirectly or be within 100 meters of her home or work. The Order allowed for limited contact through a solicitor in order to arrange contact (with the child) or for arranging the divorce proceedings. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The mother is an Irish National and the father is a National of the other Member State. The child was born in that Member State, and was habitually resident there. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No order for Residence or Contact was sought by the father or mother. The only Orders from the Courts of the other Member State related to the Conviction and the Restraining Orders. As part of the Conviction the father undertook a 30 week course of Probation and course on &#x201c;building better relationships&#x201d;. The father felt that this Report would assist him in securing contact with the child.</font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The mother unilaterally relocated to Ireland in December 2014. The father only learned of the relocation some five months later but took no legal action as he was satisfied that the child had settled in school in Ireland at that time. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The Child came to the attention of the Social Work department in Ireland following concerns raised by the school in March 2015. One concern related to the fact that the mother was late when collecting the child from school on a regular basis. The school was also concerned that the mother did not appear to take information on board; apart from those concerns it was noted that the child was appropriately attired for school and was also provided with an appropriate lunch. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The social service in the other Member State notified the social workers in Ireland that they were closing their file as the mother had relocated and was being treated for mental ill health, and that the child was in the care of his maternal uncle. Supports were put in place by the Applicant Agency at that time for the mother and child, including a family support programme. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> A private family arrangement was supported by the Agency in August 2016 and the mother subsequently signed a voluntary agreement consenting to the child coming into the voluntary care of the Agency under s. 4 of the Child Care Act, 1991 in August 2016</font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The Agency did not notify the father that the child was in voluntary care of the Agency by agreement of the mother. When he found this to be the case he commenced a formal complaint process against the Agency as they failed to notify him of the fact for a period of seven weeks.</font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The father signed a Voluntary Care Agreement for one month in October 2016. Interim Care proceedings were then commenced in November 2016 when the father withdrew his consent for the child to remain in voluntary care. </font> </p>
              <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">PROVISIONAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES UNDER ARTICLE 20</font></b> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The child remained in kinship foster care until the father refused to further extend the voluntary care agreement. The Agency applied for an Interim Care Order on the basis that the child&#x2019;s health, development and welfare would be avoidably impaired or neglected were he returned to the care of either parent at this time. The Court made an Interim Care Order in November 2016, having regard to Article 20 of EC Regulation 2201/2003 as a provisional protective measure until such time as the Court determined whether it had jurisdiction to make a substantive order in this case, or whether the Courts of the other Member State had jurisdiction to make a substantive order regarding the child, in accordance with the jurisdictional rules contained in the Regulation. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">REASONS FOR DELAY IN DETERMINING JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE</font></b> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The father experienced delay in securing legal representation in Ireland through Civil Legal Aid, pursuant to the relevant Regulation in that regard. As he was residing and working in the other Member State he found it difficult to engage with his Irish Solicitors and wished them to make submissions to the Court on the question of &#x2018;habitual residence&#x2019;. He also wished to seek an Order for custody of the child and wished to relocate the Child to the other Member State to reside with him there with his new partner. He has since secured a Decree of Divorce and wished to provide care for the child for these reasons </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Agency, the mother&#x2019;s legal team and the Guardian&#x2019;s legal team also sought permission to furnish individual written submissions on the question of the Court&#x2019;s jurisdiction. Accordingly the jurisdictional issue was not formally determined by the Court until April 2017 some five months after the Court was seized of the case. It is also noteworthy that the child has been residing with the mother in Ireland since December 2014 and with his maternal extended family since August 2016, through a voluntary care arrangement. The father also consented to this voluntary care arrangement when he was notified of same. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">HABITUAL RESIDENCE DETERMINATION</font></b><br> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Article 8 of the Regulation EC 2201/2003 provides as follows:</font> </p>
              <ul>
               <br> 
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;General jurisdiction</font></i>
               <br> 
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seised.</font></i>
               <br> 
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Paragraph 1 shall be subject to the provisions of Articles 9, 10 and 12.&#x201d;</font></i> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Through their respective legal advisors each of the parents accept that the provisions of Article 8 would have applied at the date of the removal of the child from his former habitual residence in December 2014, as the child was habitually resident in that Member State at the date of his removal. The Courts of that Member State had not determined the rights of custody of the parents nor had the Courts been asked to do so by either parent. </font></p>
              </ul> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana"> The child&#x2019;s habitual residence from birth was in the Member State where he was born and the mother&#x2019;s relocation from that Member State to Ireland in December 2014 was neither consensual nor authorised by Order of the Courts of his habitual residence. The Court is mindful of the authority provided in the case of </font>
              <b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">DE v. EB [2015] IECA 104,</font></i></b>
              <font size="2" face="Verdana"> that a unilateral decision by one parent to move a child to another country without the consent of the other is a factor which militates against a finding that there had been a change of habitual residence. The father has stated that his child was abducted by his mother, but concedes that when he found this to be the case he took no active steps to commence child abduction proceedings, or residence or contact proceedings because he was satisfied that the child was settled in school at that time. </font>
              <br> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The Court must also consider Articles 9, 10 and 12 in the circumstances of this case. I am satisfied on the evidence adduced that the father chose not to take action when he found out about the wrongful removal by the mother and accepted himself that the child was settled in Ireland. While he had the opportunity of commencing child abduction proceedings up to April 2016, he did not do so. When the child was admitted to voluntary care of the Agency with the consent of the mother in August 2016, he was not notified, as the other parent with parenting rights, for a further seven week period. However, when he was notified he subsequently consented to a voluntary care arrangement in October for a one month period. </font> </p>

              <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Article 10 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003, (commonly know as Brussels II bis Regulation) outlines the position where a child is abducted. While this Court is not concerned with child abduction, as such matters are always to be determined by the High Court, Article 10 outlines the jurisdictional rules in cases of wrongful removal or retention of a child, and provides that the courts of the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention shall retain their jurisdiction until the child has acquired a habitual residence in another Member State. It also sets out the exceptions to that rule ;</font>
