             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Glancré</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> I would add four further criteria, as follows:</font> 
             <ul>

               <ul>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i). The application for leave to appeal should be made promptly and ideally within the normal appeal period (10 days in the case of a leave application and 28 days in the case of a substantive decision). The applicant has applied promptly in the present application.</font>
                <br> 
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii). The question of law should be one which is actually determinative of the proceedings, not one which if answered differently would leave the result of the case unchanged. </font>
                <br> 
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii). The grant of leave should provide some added value to any matters already before the Court of Appeal; thus the fact that an issue is independently the subject of a pending appeal would tend to dilute the public interest in the point being brought before that court a second time.</font>
                <br> 
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv). The question must be formulated with precision in a manner that indicates how it is determinative of the proceedings and should not invite a discursive, roving, response from the Court of Appeal. </font>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul>

Mr. McDonagh asked me to add the Minister for Justice and Equality as a respondent in each of the cases and, albeit at a late stage, I did so with the consent of Ms. Denise Brett S.C. (with Ms. Lucy McRoberts B.L.) for the commissioner, who was also instructed to appear for the Minister. </font>

On the first point, Mr. McDonagh submits that the panel member or authorised officer actually conducted an investigation and no further investigation took place. He submits that the only investigation that ever took place in respect of these applicants is an investigation conducted by the panel member. Mr. McDonagh submits that therefore the commissioner has not conducted an investigation under the Act. It is suggested that &#x201c;</font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2009] IEHC 253 that a statutory function to remove a person to an approved centre could not be delegated to a contractor.

             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">by members of the staff of the approved centre</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; (see p. 2 of the judgment). Ms. Brett submits that the decision is fundamentally distinguishable because my finding in the substantive decision was that the panel member is not carrying out the investigation, he or she is simply assisting. Thus, this is not a case where the contractor is actually performing the function which is to be performed by the statutory decision-maker. There is an additional step carried out by a member of the commissioner&#x2019;s office, namely that all of the material is considered by a commission staff member. </font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The difficulty with the applicants&#x2019; first question is that its factual premise simply does not arise. I did not hold that the commissioner did not carry out an investigation. Quite the reverse. The commissioner reviewed the material before signing the s. 13 report. Such review amounts to an investigation and the decision refusing leave is premised on the basis that there are no substantial grounds to contend that the involvement of contractors went beyond assistance. </font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;. Thus the report under s. 13 is not the report of an interview under s. 13(1). However, that does not assist the applicants because the s. 13 report here was signed by the commissioner and made by him and on his behalf. </font>

             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">13. The fundamental problem with the applicants&#x2019; submission is that obtaining the assistance of a contractor is not failing to conduct an investigation. The commissioner did conduct the investigation, albeit that it was done firstly by engaging a contractor to perform work and prepare the draft reports and secondly by then reviewing those reports. </font>
             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">14. The misconception in Mr. McDonagh&#x2019;s argument is the submission that the authorised officer was responsible for the investigation. He says that reading the file is not conducting the investigation, it is reviewing the investigation. However the factual position is, as Ms. Brett submits, that the commissioner directed the preparation of drafts, and collated and gathered all the relevant materials; and the &#x201c;investigation&#x201d; consisted of reading the file in a context where preparation of materials had been done with the assistance of a contractor. </font>
             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">15. It is clear from the s. 13 reports actually adopted that the commissioner has &#x201c;</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">considered the file and all the documentation contained</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; therein and that the commissioner &#x201c;</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">agree[s] with and adopt[s]/approve[s] the draft findings of the panel member</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; (see section 4, &#x201c;</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">summary of findings</font></i>

             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">16. The respondents point out that there was no finding in the underlying judgment that &#x201c;</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">no further investigation</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; had taken place. It is true that a draft report was prepared by a contractor, but the extra step of reviewing the materials by the commissioner constituted a part of the investigation. Thus I reject the factual premise of the first question. There were no substantial grounds to contend that the acts of the contractor wholly displaced the statutory function of the commissioner and in particular displaced his investigation, and thus a question premised on such displacement does not arise out of the decision refusing leave. </font>

Mr. McDonagh initially submitted that if there had been any issue about the allegedly binding and precedential value of such a ruling, a note of MacEochaidh J.&#x2019;s decision could have been obtained. But in reply to questions, he informed me that he was present for the leave application concerned and conceded that MacEochaidh J. did not in fact give any reasons for granting leave. In the absence of reasons there is no </font>

Section 76 of the 2015 Act provides, in different and explicit terms, for contracts for services. Mr. McDonagh accepts that by contrast with the 1996 Act, the 2015 Act does permit delegation to a contractor. </font>

Mr. McDonagh submits that even if the point does not arise under the 2015 Act its relevance goes way beyond refugee law and applies in, for example, mental health legislation; but different Acts may have different conditions attached to the delegation of powers. The point made in the substantive judgment was that, absent any statutory restraint, the general law allows a statutory actor to obtain the support of contractors, and to suggest otherwise is firmly in the territory of the fanciful, and well short of the sort of substantial grounds required by s. 5 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000. </font>
