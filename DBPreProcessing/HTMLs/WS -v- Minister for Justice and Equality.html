             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2006] IEHC 250 MacMenamin J. in the High Court identified the following applicable provisions to the question of whether or not certification should be granted. Notwithstanding that the matter before MacMenamin J. was a planning issue nevertheless the principles so identified relate to comparable provisions as that contained in s. 5 (3) (a) of the 2000 Act aforesaid. These identified principles are as follows:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">“1. The requirement goes substantially further than that a point of law emerges in or from the case. It must be one of exceptional importance being a clear and significant additional requirement.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The jurisdiction to certify such a case must be exercised sparingly.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The law in question stands in a state of uncertainty. It is for the common good that such law be clarified so as to enable the courts to administer that law not only in the instant, but in future such cases.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. Where leave is refused in an application for judicial review i.e. in circumstances where substantial grounds have not been established a question may arise as to whether, logically, the same material can constitute a point of law of exceptional public importance such as to justify certification for an appeal to the Supreme Court (Kenny).</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The point of law must arise out of the decision of the High Court and not from the discussion or consideration of a point of law during the hearing.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The requirement regarding “exceptional public importance” and “desirable in the public interest” are cumulative requirements which although they may overlap, to some extent require separate consideration by the court.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The appropriate test is not simply whether the point of law transcends the individual facts of the case since such an interpretation would not take into account the use of the word “exceptional”.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. Normal statutory rules of construction apply which mean </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that “exceptional” must be given its normal meaning.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. “Uncertainty” cannot be “imputed” to the law by an applicant simply by raising a question as to the point of law. Rather the authorities appear to indicate that the uncertainty must arise over and above this, for example in the daily operation of the law in question.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Some affirmative public benefit from an appeal must be identified. This would suggest a requirement that a point to be certified be such that it is likely to resolve other cases.”</font></p>

On 25th April 2017 the respondent advised the Court that she did not intend to file any submissions in the matter and was taking a neutral position of neither objecting nor consenting to the application of the applicants.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. In page 4 of the applicant’s submissions of 22nd March 2017 reference is made to para. 30 of this Court’s judgment of 23rd February 2017 to the effect that there was a determination that it is not always the case that Article 8 rights of settled migrants will need to be considered under Article 8 (2) and it is asserted that the basis for the said finding is the ECtHR’s judgment in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Balogun v. United Kingdom</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (App. No. 60286/09) (2013) 56 EHRR 3. The submissions also refer to para. 31 of the same judgment identifying that it was held that the Minister was correct when she decided that the Article 8 rights outside of the proportionality assessment under Article 8 (2) is correct. This submission suggests that this conclusion is arrived at because the private life rights contended for were essentially not very strong.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. By way of clarification to the submission in respect of para. 31 of the judgment aforesaid it is noted that in fact four reasons were set out in that para. finding that the Minister’s assessment was rational and reasonable.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. By reason of the foregoing the submissions suggest that the approach adopted creates some considerable uncertainty in the law and the submissions suggest that there is considerable authority suggesting that the most appropriate way of assessing the nature of the rights in question is within the scope of Article 8 (2) however neither in written submissions nor in oral submissions does the applicant identify such considerable authority.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Under the heading of “the conflict in the jurisprudence” in fact no conflict is identified but rather it is suggested that the judgment of the 23rd February 2017 is on a novel point.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. In the oral submissions to the Court reference was made to the judgment of Humphreys J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rughoonauth v. Minister for Justice and Equality (No.2)</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2017] IEHC 241, for the purpose of advancing the submission that the judgment of Humphreys J. delivered on 24th April 2017 did not follow the judgment of 23rd February 2017.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. I am satisfied that the conflict asserted is not in fact the subject matter of the proposed appeal and the question suggested does not address same and therefore not sufficient to enable the applicant to secure the requisite certification on the basis of the statutory provision and jurisprudence. This view is supported by the following portion of the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rughoonauth (No.2)</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> judgment of Humphreys J.:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">“13.W.S. was a case where O’Regan J. held that if a lawful permission existed private life rights required consideration but not necessarily proportionality analysis; and again that’s what happened here. The Article 8 rights were considered and a proportionality analysis was held not to be necessary, so the outcome of W.S. and the ratio of the decision is not contrary to my ruling in the No. 1 judgment here. O’Regan J. does describe students availing of a permission as settled migrants at para. 22 and if one looks at para. 12 on W.S., O’Regan appears to equate settled migrants with lawful migrants; but doing so is not decisive in terms of the outcome of that case.”</font>

             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Conclusion</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">14. In the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights delivered on 10th April 2012 in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Balogun</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at para. 43 thereof under the heading “general principles” it is provided:- </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“the court recalls that, as Article 8 protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world and can sometime embrace aspects of an individual’s social identity, it must be accepted that the totality of social ties between settled migrants such as the applicant and the community in which they are living constitutes part of the concept of “private life” within the meaning of Article 8. Indeed it will be a rare case where a settled migrant will be unable to demonstrate that his or her deportation would interfere with his or her private life as guaranteed by Article 8. Not all settled migrants will have equally strong family or social ties in the contracting state where they reside but the comparative strength or weakness of those ties is, in the majority of cases, more appropriately considered in assessing the proportionality of the applicant’s deportation under Article 8 (2).” </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The above answers portion, if not all, of the proposed appeal question.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Paragraph 43 of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Balogun</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> aforesaid refers to “in the majority of cases” by definition therefore does not state that in all cases an Article 8 (2) proportionality assessment is required.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. At para. 25 of the Court of Appeal judgment of the 15th December 2016 in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Balchand v. Minister for Justice and Equality </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2016] IECA 383 it is provided:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">“‘Engaging’ Article 8 rights in the context in which it is used in C.I. means that it has been determined that the proposed decision of the Minister has consequences of such gravity for the applicant that it constitutes an interference with his right to respect for private or family right with the meaning of Article 8 (1) and, hence, unless justified in accordance with Article 8 (2) will constitute a breach by the State of Article 8. The issue in this appeal, having regard to the issues in the judicial review in the High Court, is whether the Minister is obliged to consider and determine whether her proposed decision not to renew permission to be in the State engages Article 8 rights in the above sense. That is a decision for the Minister and not for the court. The Minister’s decision is of course subject to judicial review.”</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">18. The question sought to be certified relates to circumstances where the Minister accepts that the deportation had “the potential to interfere with his right to respect for private life”. At para. 25 of </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Balchand</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> aforesaid it is provided that it must be determined that the proposed decision had consequences of such gravity as to constitute an interference with private and family right before the Article 8 (2) assessment is required and this is a matter from the Minister subject only to judicial review.</font>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. The suggested point of law does not amount to a qualifying issue within the meaning of s. 5 and the jurisprudence aforesaid. In addition in the circumstances as here in before outlined I am not satisfied as to the novelty of the point (Insofar as the applicant suggest that there is a difference in jurisprudence between the judgment of 23rd February 2017 and the judgment of Humphreys J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rughoonauth (No.2)</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> aforesaid, the proposed question does not in fact address such asserted conflict).</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21. By reason of the foregoing I am satisfied that this is not an appropriate matter in which a certificate pursuant to s. 5 (3) (a) of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act (2000) in respect of the point sought to be certified ought to issue – the point is not a point of law in respect of which clarification is required. The application is therefore refused.</font> </p>
