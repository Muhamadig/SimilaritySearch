             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Ms. Justice Stewart delivered on the 31st day of March, 2017.</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This is an application, dated 24th June, 2016, for an order of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">certiorari</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by way of Judicial Review quashing the decision of Judge Mary Fahy made on 25th May, 2016, at the District Court sitting in Galway, to issue two search warrants obtained by the respondent in respect of the domestic dwelling of the first-named applicant (who is the sole director of the second-named applicant) and the business premises of the second-named applicant, both of which are located in Claremorris, Co. Mayo. The warrants in question refer to alleged wrongdoing pursuant to the Trade Marks Act 1996 and were executed on 26th May, 2016. A grounding affidavit was sworn by Myles Gilvarry on behalf of the first-named applicant on 22nd June, 2016, because the first-named applicant was in Garda detention at the time and not in a position to swear the affidavit himself. An undertaking was given to furnish a verifying affidavit as soon as practicable but no such affidavit is included in the papers submitted to the Court.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Background</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Upon execution of the warrants, the respondent (who is a member of An Garda Siochana holding the rank of sergeant and based in Claremorris Garda Station) searched the two addresses named therein and seized property reasonably believed to be related to the alleged committed wrongdoing. Some or all of this property comprises of a consignment of clothing purchased from a supplier in Pakistan. The consignment entered this jurisdiction on 5th May, 2016, and was delivered to the applicants on 26th May, 2016, the same day the warrants were executed. In an affidavit sworn on 14th October, 2016, the respondent avers that he sought the warrants following an examination of the contents of this consignment, from which he concluded that they were counterfeit goods infringing upon the “PACIFIC MERCHANTS” trademark currently held by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. A file is currently being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the applicants have not been formally charged with the commission of an offence at this time. The first-named applicant maintains his innocence of any alleged wrongdoing and also seeks an order for the return of the above mentioned property.</font><br> </p>

             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Applicants’ Submissions</font></b>
             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The central argument submitted by counsel for the applicants is that the Learned Judge did not have jurisdiction to issue the impugned warrants because the wrongdoing which the applicants are suspected of committing is not an offence under Irish law, let alone an arrestable offence. It is submitted that “</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">infringement of a registered Trade Mark</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">” is a civil wrong established under s. 14 and that the Learned Judge did not have jurisdiction under s. 10(1) of the 1997 Act to issue a search warrant in respect of s. 14. In characterising the suspicions outlined in the warrants as that civil wrong, the applicants rely on the definition of infringement proceedings set out in s. 2(1) of the 1996 Act and the civil proceedings envisioned by the “</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Infringement Proceedings</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">” sub-part of the Act. The applicants also contend that the Learned Judge failed to properly appraise the wrongdoing with which they were suspected and therefore failed to meet the parameters outlined in s. 10.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. Regarding the recital of s. 92 in the warrants, the applicants concede that an arrestable offence is contained therein. But they also emphasise that the relevant section of the warrants employ terms referable to s. 14, that the constituent terms of s. 92 are not present on the face of the warrants and that the phrasing of the two wrongs are not interchangeable. In oral submissions, counsel characterised this as a failure to refer to particulars of the arrestable offence. These particulars would include elements such as “fraudulent use”. He specifically contended that the s. 92 offence is only constituted when the offending act coincides with a fraudulent intent within the meaning of s. 92(3). The applicants underlined this point by submitting that the warrants were invalid because they did not contain a reference to the mens rea of a s. 92 offence.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. The bulk of the applicants’ submissions focus on establishing the manner in which warrants should be scrutinised. They rely on the decisions in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">People (DPP) v. Mallon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2011] 2 IR 544 and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Simple Imports Ltd v. Revenue Commissioners</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2000] 2 IR 243 in submitting that the Court must adopt a searching and sceptical approach in determining whether the statutory conditions providing for a warrant are strictly met. They allege that this principle is strengthened by the constitutional protections afforded to the domestic dwelling and that the Court should keep those protections in mind when examining the warrant for the first-named applicant’s family home. The principles outlined by Macken J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">People (DPP) v. McCarthy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2010] IECCA 89 are also relied upon.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. The applicants further rely on the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">People (DPP) v. Morgan</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] IECA 50 in arguing that it ought to be clear when examining a warrant that the suspected offence is an arrestable one, so that the impacted party may know the basis on which it was issued. They highlight the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">People (DPP) v. McGoldrick</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2005] 3 IR 123, in which Denham J. (as she then was) found that “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">incorrect reference to incorrect sections of the relevant legislation</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” can render a warrant unlawful (as it did in that case, where the warrant referred to s. 143 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and not s. 140). </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. At no point did the applicants suggest that the failure to properly structure the warrants was a deliberate act of misfeasance. However, they did submit that the innocence of that mistake is irrelevant when assessing a warrant’s validity. In this regard, they rely on Murphy J.’s judgment in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">People (DPP) v. Balfe</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1998] 4 IR 50.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. Regarding the dichotomy outlined by O’Donnell J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mallon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> between innocuous errors and errors as to jurisdiction, the applicants submit that the impugned warrants belong to the latter category. In the event that the Court rules against the applicants on this point and holds that the reference to s. 92 is sufficient to maintain the warrants’ jurisdictional validity, counsel argued in oral submissions that the warrants are so erroneous on their face that they fail the three stage test outlined by Clarke J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">DPP v. Gormley</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2014] 2 IR 591. He submits that the impugned warrants fail this test because they do not refer to the elements of the offence alleged and are therefore insufficiently intelligible for the person impacted to understand the basis on which they were issued. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Respondent’s Submissions</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">12. The characterisation of s. 14 as a civil wrong is not disputed by the respondent. However, the respondent does contend that the phrase “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">infringement of a registered Trade Mark</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” has meaning outside the s. 14 context, as “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">criminal infringement</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” is common in legal parlance when referring to a s. 92 offence.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. The respondent relies on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Balfe</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as a statement on the law relating to patent defects in a warrant. It is submitted that such flaws must be sufficiently serious as to amount to inherent, fundamental defects. It is submitted that the alleged defects present in the impugned warrants currently before the Court do not reach that standard.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. The respondent recognises the strict nature of the requirements outlined in Simple Imports regarding satisfaction of the District Judge within the terms of statute. However, he also underlines the presumption set out in the judgment of Keane J. (as he then was) that the District Court Judge is presumed to act in accordance with law, unless the moving party can establish otherwise.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The respondent distinguishes the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McGoldrick</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> decision on several grounds:</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- The warrant in that case referred solely to the incorrect section of the Act, without any reference to the correct section,</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- There were a number of other errors, some of which were part of the printed form,</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- The warrant lacked clarity,</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- The documents could not be construed as meeting the strict terms of the legislative provisions.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The respondent submits that none of these flaws apply to the impugned warrants in this case. He contends that these warrants do not offend the principles set out in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McCarthy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. In particular, it is submitted that the first-named applicant, in reading the warrants, could not have failed to understand the grounds and authority under which they were issued. The respondent relies on the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mallon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> decision, and its subsequent exploration in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Morgan</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Gormley</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, in underlining the duty on the Court to have regard to the communication that these warrants seek to make.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. While it is conceded that an erroneous reference was made to s. 14, it is submitted that the simultaneous reference to s. 92 facilitates the applicants’ right to know with a reasonable level of precision what the warrants authorise and the legal basis on which they were issued.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. In rebutting the applicants’ argument regarding the lack of s. 92 phrasing in the warrant, the respondent submits that the terms of one section are not divorced and mutually exclusive from the other. He relies on English case law (such as </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R. v. Boulter</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2008] EWCA Crim 2375) and the English counterpart to the 1996 Act (the Trade Marks Act 1994) in support of this submission. The suggestion that the particulars or elements of an offence must be set out is specifically rejected as inconsistent with the Court of Appeal’s decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Morgan</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, which did not take issue with a warrant where it contains sufficient information for the arrestable nature and specifics of the offence to be inferred from it.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decision</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">18. In their submissions, the applicants placed heavy reliance on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McGoldrick</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Simple Imports</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, even going so far as to say that the latter could not be logically distinguished from the case currently before the Court. The Court cannot agree with that approach. In the case of the former, the warrant was deemed invalid because it purported to operate in relation to a statutory provision that does not establish an arrestable offence. While the impugned warrants in this case include a similar error by referring to s. 14 of the 1996 Act, the simultaneous reference to s. 92 is sufficient to distinguish this case from </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McGoldrick</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. It is also worth noting that there was not one, but a series of errors in the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McGoldrick</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> warrant. That factor appears to have had some influence on Denham J.’s reasoning and does not apply to this case, where no issue is taken with the content of the warrants besides the arrestable offence element. While one of the errors in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McGoldrick</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was the use of phrasing more properly referable to another section in the same Act, that other section was not explicitly mentioned in the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McGoldrick</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> warrant.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. With regard to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Simple Imports</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, Hardiman J. characterised that decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">People (DPP) v. Edgeworth</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2001] 2 IR 131 in the following terms on pg. 137:- </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“In (…) Simple Imports the warrant itself provided positive evidence that the condition precedent had not been met. In the present case the position is quite different: all the statutory criteria can be seen, at least on a prima facie basis, to have been met.”</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">The thrust of the applicants’ case is that the Learned Judge assessed the sergeant’s reasonable grounds of suspicion within the context of a breach of s.14 and that she issued the warrants following that assessment, without performing a similar appraisal within the context of the arrestable offence created under s. 92 (or, if she did perform such an appraisal, it is not reflected in the body of the warrants). In advancing this argument, they rely on a particular interpretation of the precise terms employed by the warrants. This is a technical exercise that goes far beyond a simple case where a warrant indicates (correctly or otherwise) on its face that a key statutory requirement was not complied with. On that basis, </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Simple Imports</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> can be distinguished from this case.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. Both parties made a variety of arguments in attempting to establish the proper interpretation of the wording contained in the warrants. The respondent submitted that the word “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">infringement</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” was to be understood in terms of “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">criminal infringement</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">”, an allegedly common phrase in legal and judicial parlance. The respondent has provided no Irish authority to support that submission. With regard to the applicants’ interpretive arguments, it is undeniable that the warrants are constructed using phrasing relative to s. 14. The terms used to describe the suspected offence mirror the shoulder note for s. 14 of the 1996 Act. The descriptor “infringed goods, material or articles” is present in the 1996 Act only in ss. 19 – 25, which relate to civil proceedings under s. 14. The influence of s. 14 in the warrant’s design is undeniable. Nevertheless, that does not render the reference to s. 92 nugatory and the Court cannot simply ignore it. In reading the two sections as a whole, the similarities in the behaviour that they seek to prevent also cannot be ignored. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21. The Court has had regard to the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Morgan</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, which states that a warrant may retain its validity if the information contained therein is sufficient to allow the arrestable nature and specifics of the offence to be inferred. Notably, the search warrant in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Morgan</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> related to the appellant’s domestic dwelling (he being 19 years old at the time and residing with his mother at the house she owned). Thus, in reaching their decision, it would appear that the Court of Appeal had regard to the appellant’s rights pursuant to Art. 40.5 of Bunreacht na hEireann, per the principles outlined in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McCarthy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. Having regard to the first-named applicant’s rights pursuant to Art. 40.5, the Court must assess whether the phrasing in the impugned warrants is sufficient to maintain their validity through the explicit reference to s. 92 and a strict interpretation of the suspected wrongdoing outlined using the s. 14 phrasing. I am of the view that their validity can be maintained in this regard.</font> </p>
