             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice White delivered on the 10th day of March, 2017 </font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This is a statutory appeal from a decision of the Employment Appeals Tribunal on the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003. (S.I. 131/2003.) The Employment Appeals Tribunal heard an appeal from the Rights Commissioner on 8th September, 2015, and 26th January, 2016, and issued its decision on 22nd February, 2016. An Originating Notice of Motion was issued on behalf of the applicant on 15th March, 2016, originally returnable for 18th April, 2016, grounded on the affidavit and exhibits of Guy Davies, General Manager of the applicant company, sworn on 14th March, 2016. A statement of opposition was filed and served on 30th May, 2016, grounded on the affidavit of Hugh Hegarty, Trade Union Official, sworn on 30th May, 2016. The appeal was heard in this Court on 13th December, 2016, and judgment was reserved.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Regulation 12(2) states:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;A party to proceedings before the Tribunal under Regulation 11 may appeal to the High Court from a determination of the Tribunal on a point of law and the determination of the High Court shall be final and conclusive.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The appellant contends that in its determination, the Tribunal erred in law as follows:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) There was no evidence before the Tribunal that the activity carried out by the respondents amounted to a stable economic entity that transferred from Manguard to the appellant.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) Strictly in the alternative, the evidence before the Tribunal was such that the decision by the Tribunal, to the effect, that the activity carried out by the respondents was a stable economic entity was irrational such that it was not open to the Tribunal to make such a finding.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) There was no evidence before the Tribunal that the activity carried out by the respondents was sufficiently structured and autonomous so as to enable the Tribunal to make a finding that it amounted to a stable economic entity. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d) There was no evidence before the Tribunal that (and the Tribunal made no findings to the effect) the activity carried out by the respondents had any functional autonomy, the concept of autonomy referring to the powers granted to those in charge of the group of workers concerned, to organise, relatively freely and independently, the work within that group, and more particularly, to give instructions and allocate tasks to subordinates within the group, without direct intervention from other organisational structures of Manguard. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(e) The finding by the Tribunal that there was a transfer of an intangible asset in circumstances where the respondents transferred, was wrong. There was no agreement to transfer the respondents. The respondents did not transfer and with the exception of the fourth respondent, who retired - remained in the employment of Manguard. In the premises, the finding that there had been a transfer of an intangible asset was based upon a false premise. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(f) There was no evidence before the Tribunal that any good will transferred. The finding by the Tribunal that there was a transfer of good will was perverse. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(g) In finding that there was a transfer of undertakings, the Tribunal misdirected itself as to import of the decisions of the ECJ opened to it and in particular the decisions of the ECJ and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Francisco Hernandez Vidal SA &amp; Ors</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1998] ECR 1-08179 and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Francisca Sanches Hidalgo &amp; Ors</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1998] ECR 1-08237. The key principles set out in those authorities are as follows:-</font> </p>
               <ul>
                <br> 
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) in certain circumstances a group of workers engaged in a joint activity on a permanent basis may constitute an economic entity; </font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) such an entity is capable of maintaining its identity after it has been transferred where the new employer does not merely pursue the activity in question but also takes over a major part, in terms of their numbers and skills, of the employees specially assigned by his predecessor to that task. In those circumstances, the new employer takes over a body of assets enabling him to carry on the activities or certain activities of the transfer or undertaking on a regular basis;</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) the mere fact that the work carried out before and after the transfer is similar does not justify the conclusion that the transfer of an entity has occurred. A stable economic entity cannot be reduced to the activity entrusted to it; </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) the identity of such an entity emerges from other factors such as its workforce, its management staff, the way in which its work is organised, its operating methods or indeed, where appropriate the operational resources available to it. </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v) a transfer must relate to a stable economic entity whose activity is not limited to performing one specific works contract. </font></p>
               </ul> 
               <br> 
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(h) Applying those principles to the activity carried out by the respondents, the Tribunal was bound to conclude that there was no transfer. There was no evidence before the Tribunal that the provision of security services at the offices of the CSSO could, on its own, amount to a stable economic entity.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) There was no evidence before the Tribunal and the Tribunal made no findings (other than the perverse finding that there was a transfer of an intangible asset) or any other factors or elements or circumstances that could rise to a finding that there was a transfer of a stable economic entity.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(j) The determination by the Tribunal that the mere fact that the appellant was now carrying on the same activity formally carried out by the respondents in and of itself meant that there was a transfer of a stable economic entity was perverse and directly contrary to the ratio of the decisions of the ECJ referred to above. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(k) The Tribunal failed to have any or any proper regard to the position of Manguard and, in particular, failed to have regard to the fact that Manguard continued to employ four of the five respondents. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(l) The Tribunal failed to have any or any proper regard to the fact that the appellant had tendered for the contract on foot of a tender process that was subject to EU Council Directive 2004/18/EC as implemented into Irish law by S.I. 329 of 2006. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(m) It was common case that the appellant had tendered for the contract on the basis that it would provide the service using its own employees. The finding of the Tribunal entirely undermines the relevant provisions of public procurement law and, in particular, undermines the fundamental requirement that contracts should be awarded on the basis of objective criteria which ensure compliance with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment and which guarantee that tenders are assessed on conditions of effective competition. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(n) The Tribunal erred in law in finding that the appellant breached Regulation 8 of the 2003 Regulations in circumstances where the respondents did not make any claim under Regulation 8. </font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The respondents to this appeal were employed as security guards providing security services to the Chief States Solicitors Office at Osmond House, Ship Street, Dublin 8 and the Chancery Building, Chancery Lane, Dublin 7. The evidence placed before the Tribunal was that the respondents were originally employed by Oscar Security each on separate dates ranging from 1988 to 2008 and all were transferred under the TUPE Regulations to Manguard Plus Limited on 25th October, 2010. They worked exclusively at these offices. On 31st May, 2013, the appellant submitted a tender to the Minister for Justice for the provision of security services at the same offices. Manguard Plus Limited was the incumbent service provider. On 19th July, 2013, the applicant was awarded the contract to provide the security services with effect from 26th August, 2013. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The tender document provided was a framework agreement for the provision of security services.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. Paragraph 3.5 stated:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Transfer of Undertakings</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Service Providers will be required to include an undertaking in their Tender and (the Contractor in any contract awarded) to comply fully with the provisions of Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12th March, 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees&#x2019; rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, business or parts of undertakings or business and is implemented in Irish law by S.I. No. 131 of 2003 European Communities (Protection of Employees and Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 and to indemnify the Contracting Authority for any claim arising or loss of costs incurred as a result of its failure or incapacity to fulfil its obligations under the said Directive and Statutory Instrument. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Service Providers are required to include an undertaking in their Tender (the Contractor in any contract awarded) indemnifying the Contracting Authority against any claim by any new contractor engaged by the Contracting Authority in the future for losses arising from the failure of the existing contractor to comply with and fulfil its obligations under the terms and conditions of its employment contracts with its employees, during the term of the said contracts, who may subsequently be engaged by the new contractor.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The request for supplementary tender was furnished by Wesley Graham, Head of Office Services, Chief States Solicitors Offices on 15th May, 2013. It was for a fixed price contract. The applicant submitted a detailed tender in writing on 31st May, 2013.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. There had been an exchange of emails on 22nd and 24th May, 2013, in which Mr. Graham made clear that &#x201c;Tenderers should note that it is not a matter for a Contracting Authority to determine whether or not the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations apply. It is a matter of law depending on the surrounding facts and on the solution to be proposed by a Tenderer. This is a matter for Tenderers to address. The Contracting Authority does not give legal advice as to the application or non-application of TUPE. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. By letter by registered post of 25th July, 2013, Sean Hall, the Operation Director of Manguard Plus Limited wrote to Mr. Guy Davies, General Manager, Top Security, Westgate House, Westgate Business Park, Ballymount, Dublin 24. The letter stated:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Dear Guy</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have been made aware that your company, Top Security, has been awarded the contract to provide Security services to the Chief States Solicitors Office at Osmond House and the Chancery commencing 25th August, 2013. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As per the requirements of the Security Service Framework Agreement, s. 3.5 and this tender award, you are required to comply with Statutory Instrument 131 of 2003, concerning the transfer of employees. This group of employees is protected under that instrument due to the unique nature of their employment, having been employed by Oscar Security at that site and then joining Manguard Plus under TUPE when we commenced this contract in October 2010 and having never worked at any other site during their employment with Manguard Plus. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We note that the Regulations require you consult with the employees affected and that this consultation must commence at least 30 days before the effective date of transfer. We also note that this consultation process has not commenced and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">de facto</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> you are not in compliance with S.I. 131 and we further believe from comments made that it is not your intention to comply with S.I. 131. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I can confirm that we have complied with a responsibility under S.I. 131 in relation to consultation and we now attach the employee information necessary to effect the transfer as further required. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unless it is evidenced in writing within 7 days that you will comply with the contractual terms regarding TUPE we will seek a judicial review of the contract award. In that instance we will use this letter to fix costs for the review in Top Security.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The appellant has accepted it did not respond to this letter nor did it communicate directly with the respondents. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. In respect of the alleged Transfer of Undertaking, the Employment Appeals Tribunal found as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Having listened to the evidence both written and oral from both parties and having observed the demeanour of the witnesses, and having regard to the wide, varied unwieldy and at times contradictory nature of the law in this area (as stated), the Tribunal is of the view that the service involved was an &#x201c;economic entity&#x201d; and not a mere activity as it involved a service provider for a profit by groups of worker/wage earners in competition with other like services rendered and was rendered in two different locations and as such comes within the definition as outlined in S.I. 131.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That their identity was retained in that they would continue to carry out the same work for the same customers/client i.e. CSSO in the same two locations as outlined and that the same customer/client would also be transferring. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That the majority of the workforce pertaining to the locations which involved the transfer of five employees of a total of eight employees in the said entity would be transferred. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That the entity involved two different locations which amounted to a part of business or undertaking pursuant to S.I. 131. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That the words and phrases &#x201c;economic entity&#x201d; and &#x201c;undertaking&#x201d; and &#x201c;business&#x201d; are used interchangeably.&#x201d;</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That the respondent agreed in evidence that a workforce and/or goodwill could amount to intangible assets and by implication amount to a transfer of intangible assets.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That in a transfer involving a service or services, that in such transfers, assets include intangible assets such as it work-force and goodwill, either solely or in addition to the transfer of tangible assets.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That the absence of a transfer of assets does not necessarily preclude the existence of a transfer of undertakings.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That the transfer would involve a change of employer.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That having regard to the letter from company M dated the 19th July 2013 stating that the client had confirmed that the TUPE Regulations would apply and requesting them to sign forms containing their details for the attention of the Respondent.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That arising from this and other undertakings given which were relied on by the appellants, that on balance it was envisaged that TUPE were part of the negotiations between the parties and that the Respondent knew or ought to have known that it was intended that TUPE Regulations would apply to this situation.</font></p>

               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The failure of a new contractor to take over an essential part of the staff which its predecessor employed to perform the same activity is not sufficient to preclude the existence of a transfer of an entity which retains its identity within the meaning of Business Transfers Directive 77/187 in a sector such as catering, where the activity is based essentially on equipment. Any other conclusion would run counter to the principal objectives of the Directive, which is to ensure the continuity, even against the wishes of the transferee, of the employment contracts of the employees of the transferor.&#x201d;</font>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The applicant is also incorrect when it asserts that four of the respondents did not lose their employment with the Transferring entity. The uncontradicted evidence was that Thomas Sadlier was re engaged by Manguard Plus Limited after unemployment of four weeks. He then covered holidays for other employees. When made permanent it was at a reduced wage. John Nicholson lost three weeks work, and recommenced work with Manguard Plus Limited at reduced wages. David Mythen was without work for eight weeks, and then procured three shifts a week, at a loss until early February 2014. Mr. Patrick Dowling worked three shifts, subsequent to the termination of his employment on 25th August, 2013. The court does not have any information about Bartosz Baziuk.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Mr. Davies in his affidavit did not agree that he had accepted in evidence that a workforce and/or goodwill could amount to intangible assets. As far as he was concerned no goodwill or employees transferred.</font> </p>

Where conclusions are based upon an identifiable error of law or an unsustainable finding of fact by a tribunal such conclusions must be corrected. Otherwise it should be recognised that tribunals which have been given statutory tasks to perform and exercise their functions, as is now usually the case, with a high degree of expertise and provide coherent and balanced judgments on the evidence and arguments heard by them it should not be necessary for the courts to review their decisions by way of appeal or judicial review.&#x201d;</font>

               <font size="2" face="Verdana">[1993] 1 I.R. 359. In his judgment, the former Chief Justice was addressing the issue of the proper procedure to be adopted on an appeal to the High Court on a question of law under s. 39 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967. What prompted his observations was that evidence had been adduced before the High Court on the appeal which had not been before the first instance and primary decision maker, the Employment Appeals Tribunal. In the passage referred to by counsel for the defendant the Chief Justice stated that the appropriate procedure is that the summons provided for by the Rules of the Superior Courts 1986 should state the decision being appealed against, the question of law which it is suggested was in error and the grounds of appeal and it should be supported only by an affidavit or affidavits exhibiting the determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, including any findings of fact or recital of evidence made by it, and, in effect, identifying the parties and the grounds on which the aggrieved party seeks a determination of the question of law&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026; More importantly, no case appears to have been made before the Rights Commissioner that her jurisdiction was spent once the concession was made on the basis that issues in relation to the terms and conditions of a contract of indefinite duration are not within the ambit of the Act. Nor was that case made before the Labour Court. Counsel for the defendant submitted that it is not open to an appellant on an appeal on a point of law from a determination of the Labour Court under s. 15(6) of the Act to present arguments as to the legal position which were not addressed to the Labour Court, citing two authorities on appeals from the Information Commissioner: the decision of this Court (McKechnie J.) delivered on 11th May, 2001 in </font>

In my view, that submission must be correct in point of principle, at any rate where the legal issue is whether the first instance decision maker (in this case the Rights Commissioner) or the appellate decision maker (in this case the Labour Court) had jurisdiction to make the relevant decision.
