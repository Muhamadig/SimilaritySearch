             <font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The court refers to the facts as stated at paras. 7–9 of its principal judgment. As identified there, the net issue at hearing came down to one of litigation privilege, an issue on which the State parties clearly won. That being so, it does not appear to the court that this is a case in which the </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Veolia Water</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> principles come fully into play, the focus of </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Veolia Water</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> being the apportionment of costs in especially complex litigation. In particular, the court does not accept the contention that this is a case in which (as contemplated by Clarke J., at para. 2.8 of his judgment in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Veolia</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">) a substantive or procedural entitlement was obtained which could not have been obtained without hearing by the court. It does not seem to the court that there was ever a moment in which the State was not going to ‘make good’ on its discovery obligations as it (correctly) perceived them to be, nor is there any evidence to suggest that its doing so was hastened by the approaching imminence of the hearing-date. All that said, it does seem to the court, as touched upon by it at para. 31 of its principal judgment, that this is a case in which very considerable allowance falls to be made as regards the apportionment of costs given the remarkable level of ‘to-ing and fro-ing’ between the parties that preceded the hearing of the application, thanks largely to the very protracted practical difficulties that the State appears to have encountered in meeting its acknowledged discovery obligations. As a result, it seems, of the said difficulties, a striking near-two years (22 months) elapsed between agreement being reached between the parties as to the discovery to be made by the State parties and the receipt by the plaintiffs of an affidavit of discovery. The plaintiffs have questioned (though the court cannot supply an answer) whether even this belated making of discovery would have been achieved had it not been for the imminent approach of the hearing-date. Notably, however, even the State’s own counsel indicated at hearing that the circumstances that had arisen might fall to be reflected in a costs order. </font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> that a court’s discretion as to the awarding of costs falls and ought to fall to be applied by reference to principle, Clarke J. effectively makes five points of interest concerning the according of costs in ‘test cases’. These are set out below. (References to paragraph numbers are to the numbering in the judgment of Clarke J. of 12th October 2007, commencing at 484).</font>

              </ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) Clarke J. does not closely define the meaning of what constitutes a ‘test case’ but appears to contemplate the term as embracing cases in which the following criteria present: (a) there is doubt about the proper interpretation of the common law, the Constitution or statute law involving the private relations between the parties, and (b) the circumstances giving rise to those doubts apply in very many cases, and (c) the case in issue is one of that small number of cases which happen to be first tried and so yield a resultant clarification as to the legal issues arising. (para. 13). </font>

                 </ul>

               </ul> 
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) Where proceedings involve entirely private parties, it seemed to Clarke J. that there was no proper basis for departing from the ordinary rule in relation to costs. (para. 13)</font> 
               <ul> 
                <ul>

               </ul> 
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) At the other end of the spectrum, it seemed to Clarke J. that in a case concerning the construction of legislation of widespread and general application it would be open to the court to weigh in the balance in considering costs the fact (if so, and to the extent so) that the litigation was necessitated by the complexity or difficulty of the said legislation (for which the Minister or Ireland would be responsible), (para. 14)</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(4) Between these two extremes sat, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">e.g</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">., that case in which Clarke J. was giving judgment, where a public authority with no responsibility for the applicable (opaque) legislation, but answerable to the ministry that was responsible, was grappling with the meaning of the said legislation in the same manner as everyone else. Here Clarke J. considered the case closer to situation (3) than situation (2). (para.15)</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(5) In situation (3) and situation (4), Clarke J. considered that the court retains a discretion to consider whether there should be some departure from the normal rule in respect of costs. (para. 16).</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">4. </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Shackleton</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> treats as normative that an entitlement to costs generally arises on the part of the victor in court proceedings. There is no doubt that such an approach to costs serves several beneficial ends. It vindicates the rightfulness of the winner's position, thus promoting a sense of fairness. It performs a compensatory function, making whole the victor for the wrong of having been forced to come to court to secure her rights. It penalises excessive litigation, may encourage meritorious litigation (by parties who consider a particular claim/defence to have a high probability of success) and, by encouraging swiftness and settlements in actions, likely even promotes efficiency in litigation. However, it is an approach to costs that is not without flaw. Most notably, the prospect of having to pay an opponent’s legal expenses may unjustly de
