An originating motion dated 7th July, 2015, was issued returnable for 20th October, 2015. A statement of opposition on behalf of the defendants was filed and served on 5th November, 2015. Tina Burns, Assistant Principal Officer of the Department of Social Protection swore an affidavit on behalf of the defendants on 5th November, 2015. Eugene Banks, Principal Officer in the Department of Justice and Equality swore an affidavit on 10th November, 2015, dealing with the direct provision system for those who have applied for asylum or applied to remain resident in the Republic of Ireland. The sixth applicant swore an affidavit in reply to this on 11th January, 2016. The matter was at hearing on 10th, 11th, 12th and 31st May, 2016 and judgment was reserved.</font>

              <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Factual Background of First Action</font></b>
             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The facts of the case are undisputed. The fifth and sixth applicants are citizens of Afghanistan who came to Ireland in May 2008 and resided within the direct provision system from May 2008 to 1st December, 2008, and from 1st June, 2010 onwards. They have four children, Rahmat born in Pakistan on 20th May, 2006; Naymatullah born in Ireland on 10th August, 2008; Maria born on 26th July, 2009 in Ireland; and Daniel born on 5th April, 2013 in Ireland. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. On first arrival in Ireland in 2008, the fifth and sixth applicants were treated as Pakistani nationals as they originally had Pakistani identity documents which were false. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. Subsequently, their citizenship of Afghanistan was established by way of passports and identity papers. The original decision was to transfer the family to the United Kingdom under EU rules but the fifth and sixth applicant went into hiding. Subsequently, deportation orders were signed by the Minister for Justice in March 2012, on the basis that they were Pakistani nationals. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. However, once their Afghanistan citizenship was established, the youngest son, Daniel, the first applicant made an application for refugee status. The Refugee Appeals Tribunal on appeal from the Refugee Applications Commissioner issued a decision in writing on 9th December, 2014, declaring the first applicant to be a refugee. This was communicated by letter of 8th January, 2015, to the first applicant from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. Subsequently, on 14th January, 2015, the fifth and sixth applicants together with the remaining members of their family applied pursuant to s. 18 of the Refugee Act 1996 for family reunification. That permission was granted on 11th September 2015, by letter from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service when the family were permitted to remain with the first applicant, Daniel. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. There is no allegation in this case that there was any culpable delay on dealing with the application for refugee status of the first applicant or the application to remain of the rest of the family. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. The sixth applicant made an application for child benefits for all her children on 19th February, 2015, and the first respondent issued a written decision on 2nd April, 2015, claim reference No. 1415262E. The letter stated as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;I refer to your claim for child benefit made on 19th February, 2015.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of child benefit is that you must be habitually resident in this State. I have decided that you do not satisfy the condition of being habitually resident in this State for the following reason. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You are awaiting a decision from the Department of Justice and Equality on your residency application and you do not, as yet, have the right to reside in the State. Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended), explicitly states that a person who has not been granted permission to remain in the State shall not be regarded as being habitually resident.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. In the second Action by order of this court on 7th December, 2015, the court granted the applicants leave to seek the following reliefs:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>

               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) A declaration that s. 246(5), s. 246(7)(a) and/or s. 246(7)(d) and/or s. 246(8) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) are contrary to, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, Article 20 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, in the premises that the second named applicant derives a right to reside in the State premised upon her parentage of the second named applicant and that the said right is merely declaratory and persist not from the date of recognition in this State but from the date of the birth of the first named applicant.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) In the alternative, and without prejudice to the foregoing, a declaration that, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, s. 246(5), s. 246(7)(a) and/or s. 246(7)(d) and s. 246(8) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, are unconstitutional in the premises that, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the said sections have the effect of discriminating against the second named applicant by treating her unequally before the law with other Irish citizen children in an unjustified manner and are disproportionate, arbitrary and contrary to reason and fairness insofar as the sections wholly prohibit the payment of a Social Welfare payment intended for the first named applicant&#x2019;s benefit. </font> </p>

             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">12. The facts are not in dispute. In an affidavit sworn on 4th December, 2015, the second affidavit, Faith Osagie, the mother of the first applicant stated,</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;5. I say that I am a national of Nigeria. I arrived into this State on or about November 2013. I say I have applied for asylum on 21st November, 2014. I say I have received a negative decision from the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner refusing me refugee status, decision dated 16th June, 2015 and 27th August, 2015. I further say that the said decision has been appealed to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on 9th October, 2015, and I am awaiting an oral hearing for my case.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. I say that in the early part of 2014, I met with my daughter&#x2019;s father, Olusegun Osinuga, who is an Irish citizen. On 23rd December, 2014, our daughter, Victoria, was born. Victoria is an Irish citizen, as evidenced by a copy of her passport&#x2026;.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. I say that the relationship between me and Mr. Olusegun Osinuga is not ongoing but that he occasionally sees Victoria and occasionally provides small sums of money by way of support. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. I say that following the birth of Victoria, I sought permission to remain in the State by virtue of my Irish born child. This application has not yet been determined&#x2026;.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. I say that in late January 2015, I received a letter dated 15th January, 2015, from the Child Benefit Section inviting me to apply for child benefit. I say that I made a claim for child benefit to the first named respondent in respect of Victoria on 16th October, 2015&#x2026;. By decision dated 2nd November, 2015, the first named respondent refused my application on the premise that I did not have a right to reside for the purposes of s. 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, (as amended) and therefore could not be habitually resident&#x2026;.</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">13. She went on to state at para. 12:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;12. I say that raising my daughter is very difficult given the circumstances we are living in as we are in direct provision accommodation and received less that &#x20ac;43 weekly together with food and lodgings. Victoria has sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) which is a severe hereditary form of anaemia.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">14. In January 2016, the Minister for Justice and Equality granted the second applicant leave to remain on the basis of her parentage of the first applicant who was born on 23rd December, 2014 and she has been in receipt of child benefit payments since that date. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The issue which is relevant to the court&#x2019;s determination is an allegation by the applicants that child benefit should have been retrospectively paid from the date of birth of the first applicant on 23rd December, 2014, up to the date in January 2016, when the second applicant was granted leave to remain. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. The first and second applicants in the second action have been in receipt of the services of the direct provision systems since the first applicant&#x2019;s birth in December 2014. The direct provision system has been explained in detail in the affidavit of Eugene Banks of the Department of Justice and Equality sworn on 6th May, 2016.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. The second applicant made a claim for child benefit on 16th October, 2015, and was notified by letter of 2nd November, 2015, by the Social Welfare services of the Department of Social Protection that her claim had been unsuccessful. The reasons given in the letter are as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of child benefit is that you must be habitually resident in this State. I have decided that you do not satisfy the condition of being habitually resident in this State for the following reason.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You are awaiting a decision from the Department of Justice and Equality on your residency application and you do not as yet have the right to reside in the State. Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005,(as amended,) explicitly states that a person who has not been granted permission to remain in the State shall not be regarded as being habitually resident.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">18. As the legal submissions in both cases are broadly similar and relate to the same legal issue it is appropriate to consider the legal principles in both cases in tandem.</font>

To establish what exactly is the nature of child benefit, it is appropriate that the court look no further than the legislation itself which has already been summarised by the court and is set out at Part 4 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. Having examined Part 4, the court is satisfied that the interpretation placed on the benefit by Tina Burns Assistant Principal Officer of the first respondent in her affidavit sworn on 10th November, 2015, is the correct interpretation. </font>

The applicants contend that as the First applicant was granted refugee status on 8th January 2015, and as s. 18 consent would follow almost automatically, child Benefit should have been backdated at least from 8th January 2015. </font>

The provisions of the Act are such that a person who is found to be a refugee does not have the benefits of refugee status backdated under the Act and it follows that if this Court were to accept the interpretation of s. 9(2) of the Act contended for by the applicant, such interpretation would be inconsistent with the other provisions of the Act.&#x201d; </font>

             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Blakesley v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">, Jackson L.J. first analysed Article 23 of the Geneva Convention which states:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Public Relief </font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Contracting States shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">35. At para. 32 of his judgment, Jackson L.J. compared the wording in different Articles of the Convention by stating:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;It can be seen that articles 20, 22, 24.2, 24.3, 24.4 and 33 apply to &#x2018;refugees&#x2019;. Articles 23 and 24.1 apply to &#x2018;refugees lawfully staying in their territory&#x2019;. Article 32 applies to &#x2018;a refugee lawfully staying in their territory&#x2019;.</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">36. He went on to state at para. 41:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;41. If it was intended that all welfare benefits should be backdated for genuine refugees, article 23 would have referred to &#x2018;refugees&#x2019;, not &#x2018;refugees lawfully staying in their territory&#x2019;. A refugee is only &#x2018;lawfully staying in&#x2019; the UK once it is established that he/she is indeed a refugee. During the earlier period, although he/she is a refugee, no-one knows that this is the case. His/her presence is tolerated, because the UK cannot take the risk of expelling someone who may turn out to be a genuine refugee. His/her presence only becomes &#x2018;lawful&#x2019; under UK law when the proper authority (either the Secretary of State or on appeal a tribunal) has determined that the person is a refugee.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">42. In my view this interpretation is entirely consistent with the broad humanitarian aims of the Convention. Both category 1 and category 2 asylum seekers receive accommodation and support at a basic level while their claims are being processed. As soon as that process is complete, the category 1 asylum seekers become established refugees and receive the full range of mainstream benefits. Taking the facts of the present case as an example, I do not see how it serves the broad humanitarian aims of the Geneva Convention to pay to the appellant a large lump sum representing historic accumulated income support. The appellant has received proper support, albeit under a different statutory regime, ever since she arrived in this country.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">37. The court then went on to deal with Article 28 of Council Directive 2004/83/EC which states:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;1. Member States shall ensure that beneficiaries of refugee or subsidiary protection status receive, in the Member State that has granted such statuses, the necessary social assistance, as provided to nationals of that Member State.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. By exception to the general rule laid down in paragraph 1, Member States may limit social assistance granted to beneficiaries of subsidiary protection status to core benefits which will then be provided at the same levels and under the same eligibility conditions as nationals.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">38. At para. 57, the Honourable Judge stated:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;57. I have nevertheless carefully considered both the recitals and the text of the Qualification Directive to see whether it goes beyond the requirements of the Geneva Convention in relation to the back-payment of welfare benefits. I do not think that it does. Recitals 14, 33 and 34 do not suggest any such intention. Nor do the general provisions of chapter VII.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">58. In my view the phrase &#x2018;beneficiaries of &#x2026; refugee protection&#x2019; in article 28 means persons whose status as refugees has been established. The verb &#x2018;receive&#x2019; means &#x2018;receive from then onwards&#x2019;. There is no express or implied obligation to make a lump sum payment representing the difference between the earlier asylum support payments or benefits in kind and mainstream benefits. If there were such a requirement, I would expect to see further provisions in the Qualification Directive explaining at least in outline how this should be achieved. In particular, some mechanism should be specified for reconciling the different regimes in the Reception Directive and the Qualification Directive. The Directives do not contain any such mechanism.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">39. He went on to state at para. 65 &amp; 72,</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;65. Secondly, there is no analogy between asylum seekers and British citizens in need of social assistance. In the case of asylum seekers it is not known whether they have any entitlement to be in this country. Therefore they all receive support under an asylum support scheme, which complies with the obligations imposed by the Geneva Convention and the Reception Directive. British citizens in need of social assistance are in a different position and they receive mainstream benefits.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">72. In my view the UK is entitled to establish a support scheme for asylum seekers which is less generous than mainstream benefits, provided that it complies with the requirements of Council Directive 2003/9/EC (the Reception Directive). Successful asylum seekers receive the same welfare benefits as UK citizens as from the date when their refugee status is established. The international instruments upon which the appellant relies do not require the UK Government to make lump sum payments to successful asylum seekers representing the difference between previous asylum support and mainstream benefits.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">40. In summary, the consent granted to an asylum seeker pursuant to s. 9 of the Refugee Act 1996, to enter the State and remain there is a restricted consent pending the determination of the status of the asylum seeker. If the asylum seeker is subsequently granted refugee status or family reunification the legal rights that accrue to the applicant and flow from the new status operate from the date of the grant of declaration by the relevant body in this State and are not backdated so as to entitle the asylum seeker to claim benefits he or she would not be entitled to if not entitled to reside in the State. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">41. The Republic of Ireland has opted to deal with the welfare of asylum seekers by way of direct provision rather than using the provisions of social protection and social welfare legislation. This system of direct provision for the purposes of these proceedings has been set out in detail in the affidavit of Eugene Banks, sworn on 10th November, 2015.</font><br> </p>

               <font size="2" face="Verdana">rights does not detract from the entitlement to those rights, which is derived solely from EU law, or from the compulsory nature of the granting of those rights, as determined by the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. The effect of the rights is the ostensible dis-applying of long-standing Supreme Court authority and domestic statutory provisions which would otherwise have curtailed the rights of such persons.&#x201d;</font>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">45. The Respondents have submitted that is not the case. Paras 26 and 27 of their submissions state:-</font> </p>

               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> had the effect of requiring the citizens of the Union to leave the territory of the Union in order to accompany their parents. Such a scenario was in direct contradiction to the substance and meaning of Union citizenship.

               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27. It is clear therefore, that a central tenet of the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Zambrano</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is that the national measure must have the effect of depriving the Union citizen child of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights attaching to the status of the EU citizen before such measure can be said to offend Article 20 of the TFEU.</font></p>

There have been a number of decided cases in this jurisdiction in respect of EU citizens who have come to Ireland as self employed persons whose work dried up and who were not entitled to claim social welfare entitlements because they had no longer a right to reside in Ireland. In that context, the High Court in a number of decisions has had to consider if this provision is discriminatory in particular in applying EU law. These have been outlined in the written submissions of the respondents. In particular in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Genov &amp; Anor v.

               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The respondents state that it has always been and it remains the State&#x2019;s view that those without a right to reside in the State should not have access to social welfare entitlements and thus have made this a requirement in s.246 cited above. I accept the respondents&#x2019; argument that this provision is objectively justified in the interests of preserving the limited resources of this State in funding its social welfare system. This clearly is a logical and reasonable rationale, is one that stands independent of the nationality of the applicants herein because it applied to all citizens of Member State other than Ireland regardless of their nationality and seems proportionate to the legitimate aim of best using the limited resources of the State.&#x201d;</font></i>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">51. In respect of the applicant family in the First Action the children of the fifth and sixth applicants are in two distinct categories. The first applicant as and from 8th January, 2015, was recognised as a refugee and thus, had a right to reside and was deemed to have habitual residence. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">52. The second, third and fourth applicants minor children of the fifth and sixth applicants, did not have refugee status but were ultimately granted family reunification status on 11th September, 2015, pursuant to the provisions of s. 18 of the Refugee Act 1996. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">53. Insofar as the second, third and fourth applicants are concerned, the sixth applicant was never in a position to claim child benefit for these children. The sixth applicant was in direct provision from her arrival in the country. Her legal status was not finalised until 11th September, 2015, when she was granted family reunification pursuant to s. 18 of the Refugee Act 1996. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">54. All of the decided case law of the High Court and Supreme Court has indicated that the presence of an asylum seeker pursuant to s. 9 of the Refugee Act 1996, does not confer a right of residence or habitual residence on the applicant. The relevant cases are, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Gonescu &amp; Ors v Minister for Justice &amp; Ors </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2003] IESC 49 Supreme Court Murray C.J.; </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sofroni &amp; Ors v.

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">55. I cannot see how this is arbitrary or unfair. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">56. The Oireachtas has determined that a prerequisite for the payment of child benefit to a qualified person is habitual residence. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">57. The sixth applicant by reason of her status as a citizen of another State seeking asylum in Ireland was not habitually resident in Ireland when she made an application for child benefit on 13th February, 2015. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">58. Between 8th January, 2015, and September 2015, the period for which the first applicant had refugee status, the sixth applicant the relevant putative qualified person still did not have habitual residence in Ireland. This did not come about until she was granted family reunification rights on 11th September, 2015. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">59. Section 246(8) of the Act specifically restricts the designation of habitual residence for any period before the date she was granted family reunification rights, thus the first respondent had no discretion in law to backdate the benefits prior to 11th September, 2015. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">60. While no anomalous situation arises in respect of the second, third and fourth applicants, it does lead to an anomalous situation for the first applicant, in that the generally regarded position was that once the first applicant was granted refugee status, his parents, as a matter of course, would be granted family reunification rights unless there was serious security implications arising in granting that. So to that extent, for the short period of time from 8th January, 2015, to 11th September, 2015, the position of the first applicant in relation to the payment of child benefit was different to that of the chid of a qualified parent who had a right of residence. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">61. I do not regard this as constitutionally infirm in accordance with Irish constitutional principles, as the first applicant had at all times the right to reside with the sixth applicant in direct provision and was having his needs met by direct provision. Though not ideal, it was objectively justified as the respondent was entitled to preserve the requirement of habitual residence for Social Welfare benefits.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">62. I cannot see how there was invidious discrimination applicable in the case of the first applicant. Habitual residence conditions apply equally to Irish citizens and non-Irish citizens and the equality guarantee in the Constitution does not require identical treatment for all persons without recognition of difference of circumstances. While the court has some concerns about the absolute nature of s. 246(8) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, the court would not regard that provision of the Act as unconstitutional, as it is consistent with the regime that the State has put in place to comply with the Geneva Convention and Council Directive 2004/83/EC. I do not consider that the provisions of ss. 220(3), 246(5) 246(7) and 246(8), breach the provisions of s. 3(2)(ii) and 18(3) of the Refugee Act 1996, or Articles 20, 23, 28 of Council Directive 2004/83/EC. </font> </p>
