             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I. Background</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Mr Ganley is a prominent businessman. RTÉ is Ireland&#x2019;s national broadcaster and, at all material times, the maker of a successful current affairs television programme known as &#x2018;Prime Time&#x2019;. RTÉ maintains an online presence at </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">www.rte.ie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. Mr Ganley maintains that in an edition of &#x2018;Prime Time&#x2019; aired on 27th November, 2008, RTÉ published words that were defamatory of Mr Ganley, and that it allowed on-line access to the impugned programme thereafter. In these proceedings, Mr Ganley seeks, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, damages, including aggravated and/or exemplary damages, for the alleged defamation.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">II. The Proceedings to Date</font></b><br> <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) Statement of Claim delivered on 17th April 2012</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Mr Ganley&#x2019;s plenary summons issued on 15th December 2011. The statement of claim was delivered on the following 17th April. Mr Ganley alleges at para. 6 of his statement of claim that in their natural and ordinary meaning and/or by way of innuendo the words broadcast by RTÉ in the programme and on its website &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">were meant and were understood to mean</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; that Mr Ganley </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;(a)&#x2026;had links to organized crime; (b)&#x2026;falsely claimed to be a paid advisor to the government of Latvia; (c)&#x2026;had a direct business relationship with a [Mr] Kostas Tribecka who worked for him at a company called Anglo Adriatic; (d)&#x2026;had a close friendship with [Mr] Kostas Tribecka and had associated him on a trip; (e)&#x2026;was somehow involved in the death of&#x2026;[Mr] Kosta Tribecka and, using the juxtaposition of pictures of the dead man&#x2019;s body, deliberately and shockingly shown; alongside words linking his death to the Anglo Adriatic Fund which it was alleged&#x2026;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley] </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was behind, raised obvious suspicions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was responsible for or involved in</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;[Mr Tribecka&#x2019;s] </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">; (f) [Mr Ganley] </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">falsely and misleadingly claimed to have done a deal to bundle six television stations together in Central America</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">; (g)&#x2026;[Mr Ganley&#x2019;s] </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">actions caused the Anglo Adriatic Fund to lose the life savings of thousands of Albanian pensioners</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1]&#x2026;(h) [Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was covertly working for the United States&#x2019; Central Intelligence Agency and/or an ill-defined group known as the &#x2018;Neocons&#x2019;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;. Mr Ganley further claims that: by reason of the broadcast of the words he has been gravely damaged in his character and reputation and has suffered considerable distress and embarrassment; and RTÉ, its servants or agents, were malicious in, the allegedly highly partisan tone of the programme.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[1] At the hearing of the within applications, counsel for Mr Ganley suggested (Day 1, p.16) that, inter alia, item (g) claims that Mr Ganley &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ripped off thousands of Albanian pensioners by his actions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;. It appears to the court that this is not strictly correct and that while it is claimed that &#x201c;[Mr Ganley&#x2019;s] </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">actions caused the Anglo Adriatic Fund to lose the life savings of thousands of Albanian pensioners</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;, it is not expressly claimed in item (g) that this occurred pursuant to some form of fraud or &#x2018;rip-off&#x2019;.</font> </p>

                <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [Mr Ganley]&#x2026;.</font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Without prejudice to the foregoing, it is denied that the words broadcast, in their natural and ordinary meaning or by way of innuendo bore or were understood to bear any of the several meanings alleged at paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim save for the meaning pleaded at paragraph 6(f)</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.[1]</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [[1] This is an unambiguous claim of innuendo as it existed before the coming into force of the Defamation Act 2009. And it will be recalled that Mr Ganley, at para. 6 of his Statement of Claim alleges that the words used in the impugned RTÉ broadcast, whether in their natural and ordinary meaning and/or by way of innuendo bore or were understood to bear certain meanings. In essence, innuendo arises, to borrow from McMahon and Binchy&#x2019;s </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Law of Torts</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (4th ed.), para. 34-105, where &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">a seemingly innocent remark may be shown to be defamatory because of a hidden significance which the uttered words bear</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;. The learned authors then go on to distinguish between popular innuendo (where the defamatory meaning can be construed from the words themselves) and legal innuendo (where extrinsic or additional information must be produced). In the present case, notwithstanding the pleas made, it does not appear that any innuendo is truly being claimed.] </font> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. Insofar as the words broadcast bore the meaning pleaded at paragraph 6(f), the same were true in substance and in fact.</font></i> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">If, which is denied, the words broadcast bore the meanings pleaded at paragraph 6(c) and 6(d) of the Statement of Claim</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;[RTÉ] </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">denies that the said meanings are defamatory meanings as alleged or at all.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. If, which is denied, the words broadcast bore the meanings pleaded at paragraphs 6(c) and (d) of the Statement of Claim and if, which is denied, the said meanings or either of them are defamatory, the same are true in substance and in fact to the extent that</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">and Mr Kosta Trebicka both worked in connection with the Anglo Adriatic Investment Fund (and were among a small number of persons engaged in doing so). The Fund itself accepted vouchers, many of which were bought on an unofficial market, but it was never allowed to invest them in privatised enterprises. People who had deposited vouchers in the Fund felt aggrieved that the Fund ceased trading with little or no explanation to depositors.</font></i> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. If, which is denied, the broadcast bore the meaning pleaded at paragraph 6(b) of the Statement of Claim, the same was true in substance and in fact to the extent that [Mr Ganley]&#x2026;frequently exaggerated his role, vis-à-vis the Latvian Government in the early stages of Latvian independence.</font> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">10.

At the time of the broadcast</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, [Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was in the process of establishing a political party and had indicated an intention to run candidates in a number of EU member states in the European Parliamentary elections in 2009. There was much public speculation about his business and financial interests, both past and present. The programme set out to investigate these issues and in so doing to give</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;[Mr Ganley] </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">an opportunity to participate. The programme was fair, reasonable, accurate and balanced. It was measured in its content and tone</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;.[Mr Ganley</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">] and his supporters were given ample opportunity to respond to allegations and answer questions which were in the public interest.

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2] It will be recalled from para. 6 of the Defence quoted above that RTÉ claims that &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Insofar as the words broadcast bore the meaning pleaded at paragraph 6(f), the same were true in substance and in fact</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;. So RTÉ denies the meanings pleaded by Mr Ganley. Part of the reason why RTÉ denies this meaning can be seen in the above-quoted para. 12 of the Defence where the plea of qualified privilege is raised. In effect, what is being claimed here is what is sometimes referred to as the &#x2018;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Reynolds</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Defence&#x2019;, a shorthand reference to the qualified privilege that can (or at least could in the past) arise in respect of discussions of political/public figures and which was the subject of some focus in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Reynolds v. Times Newspaper Ltd</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1999] 1 All ER 609 (and the perhaps more illuminating decision of the House of Lords in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jameel v.

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. Mr Ganley&#x2019;s first affidavit of discovery was sworn on 27th August, 2014. RTÉ later pointed, in a letter of 8th December, 2014, to what it contended were a number of deficiencies in this affidavit of discovery. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. First, in the First Schedule, Part 1, the affidavit merely recited a list of documents without indicating which documents related to which category of discovery, with the result, RTÉ claimed, that it was unable to assess properly the completeness or otherwise of the discovery made. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Second, in the First Schedule, Part 2, the affidavit referred to generic categories of documents over which privilege was being claimed, rather than listing the relevant documents. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. Third, in the Second Schedule, Part 1, RTÉ contended that what it considered were the relatively small number of documents being made available to it via discovery suggested that Mr Ganley&#x2019;s businesses and activities had largely been run on an almost entirely oral basis.</font> </p>
             <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vii) The Order for Discovery of 4th February, 2015.</font></i> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Pursuant to a notice of motion of 5th December, 2014, the High Court ordered, on consent, that RTÉ within eight weeks make discovery of various categories to Mr Ganley.</font> </p>
             <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(viii) Mr Ganley&#x2019;s Second Affidavit of Discovery Sworn on 10th April, 2015.</font></i> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. On 10th April, 2015, Mr Ganley swore a second affidavit of discovery. This time the First Schedule, Part 1, listed the various documents referred to therein on a per category basis. The First Schedule, Part 2 again identified privileged documentation on a generic basis. The Second Schedule, Part 1 again appeared, at least to RTÉ, to be notably brief, though it now also indicated that &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Electronic files stored on my</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [Mr Ganley&#x2019;s] </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">computer system relating to the telecommunications network in Iraq which were wiped from my system on or about 2008</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#x201d; This second affidavit of discovery elicited the following response from RTÉ to Mr Ganley&#x2019;s solicitors by letter of 21st April, 2015:</font> </p>
             <ul>

Confusingly it is also headed &#x2018;Affidavit of Discovery&#x2019; as though an Affidavit of Discovery had not been filed and served before this one. We are in the process of examining what is in fact a supplemental Affidavit of Discovery and not an original Affidavit of Discovery to ascertain the significance of the differences between the two, if any.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">To be absolutely clear, we take it from the most recent Affidavit being titled &#x2018;Affidavit of Discovery&#x2019;, that you acknowledge that out complaints about your original Affidavit were well-founded&#x2026;.In the circumstances, we have had your recent &#x2018;real&#x2019; Affidavit of Discovery&#x2026;for less than one week. We must have time to read it and consider its contents&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since our request for discovery was made prior to your request for discovery, we believe we are entitled to undertake this exercise before finalising our own Affidavit, and making our documentation available for inspection&#x2026;.[1]</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">We do not wish to make any inappropriate allegations in relation to the earlier deficiencies in your Affidavit of Discovery. For this reason, we refrain from making any comments in relation to substance until such time as our client has had an opportunity to review the documents fully. We appreciate that our obligation to make discovery is not affected by any knowledge of the documents which you intend to discover, but this is an obligation which works both ways and we are anxious to ensure the process is completed properly by both [</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">RTÉ and Mr Ganley</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">]&#x201d;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[1] This assertion has no basis in law. RTÉ was under a separate obligation to comply with the High Court order for discovery. That obligation was not dependent on the quality of discovery being made by Mr Ganley.</font></i></p>

              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">14. By 29th April, 2015, RTÉ had enjoyed the opportunity to consider more fully the Second Affidavit of Discovery sworn by Mr Ganley. Again, it had various queries concerning the adequacy of Mr Ganley&#x2019;s discovery. So, for example, it noted that Mr Ganley appeared to have skipped categories (b), (h) and (i) of the requested documentation and sought &#x201c;</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">urgent written confirmation that </font></i>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#x201d; </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. RTÉ also pointed to what it claimed were various gaps in such documents as had been provided. It complained again about the limited substance of the First Schedule, Part 2, and the Second Schedule. And it also sought an explanation of &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">how it is that electronic files stored on</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [Mr Ganley&#x2019;s] </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">computer system relating to the telecommunications network in Iraq were &#x2018;wiped from the system&#x2019; in or around 2008</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. [Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">might explain how it is that only electronic files relating to </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[the] </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">telecommunications network in Iraq and none of the other categories were &#x2018;wiped&#x2019; if that is in&#x2026;fact the case and furthermore, how it is that a person such as your client did not have the system backed up. It is all the more surprising that these electronic files are the ones that are missing given the controversy surrounding the project</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#x201d; </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. RTÉ then continued by suggesting that given what it perceives to be Mr Ganley&#x2019;s &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">deficient</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; discovery, notwithstanding two affidavits of discovery, and despite its acceptance that each side&#x2019;s obligation to discovery was &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">separate and independent of the other&#x2019;s</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;, it proposed, in circumstances where its discovery was &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">all but complete</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;, that it would lodge its affidavit of discovery (with schedules) in court but without providing the schedules to Mr Ganley&#x2019;s solicitors &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">until such time as the issues regarding</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [Mr Ganley&#x2019;s]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">affidavit of discovery have been resolved by the Court, or otherwise</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;. This letter also indicated RTÉ&#x2019;s intention, if matters were not resolved to its satisfaction within 14 days of its letter, it would proceed to issue a motion for leave to cross-examine Mr Ganley and/or seeking to strike out Mr Ganley&#x2019;s claim; these are among the applications now before this Court.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. What had Mr Ganley to say, via his solicitors as to the allegations being made regarding the adequacy of his discovery thus far? In letters of 1st and 5th May, 2015, Mr Ganley&#x2019;s solicitors vigorously rejected all of RTÉ&#x2019;s allegations as to any inadequacies or improprieties presenting in the discovery process, and disputing whether an order for cross-examination on an affidavit of discovery was a relief that was available to RTÉ. This last aspect of matters is addressed later below. It suffices now to recite a portion of the letter of 1st May so as to give a full sense of the view being taken of how matters stood from the perspective of Mr Ganley and his counsel:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">We will deal with the various, and somewhat pedantic, procedural points you have raised in relation to the formatting of our Schedule of Documents.[1] In the meantime, we would express our serious concern, and indeed bewilderment, at what appears to be a brazen attempt to delay the prosecution of this case.</font></i> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[1] In fairness to RTÉ, it was by this point dealing with a plaintiff who had sworn a first affidavit of discovery that was deficient, a second affidavit of discovery that made casual mention of the wiping of the Iraq-related files (and, as later proved to be the case, inaccurately so), each of which affidavits seemed and seem to contain a notably limited number of documents given the breadth of discovery sought by RTÉ. So to describe RTÉ&#x2019;s concerns as &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">pedantic, procedural points</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; is not an accurate depiction that real and substantive concerns were being raised, or at least were also being raised, by it.</font> </p>

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">You were put on notice a considerable time ago that the Discovery documentation was available for inspection at our office and you failed to avail of the opportunity to review same.

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">You will of course have the opportunity to cross-examine out client in the witness box at the substantive Hearing, and therefore we would invite you to support an application to the Court to have this action listed for Hearing during the week commencing 22nd June, and that both parties co-operate and work together to ensure that all appropriate documentation is made available in order to avoid any unnecessary burden on the Court&#x2019;s time.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this regard, we remain open to any reasonable proposals, but we would repeat that the first step ought to be the mutual disclosure and inspection of the documentation that both parties have indicated is now readily available.&#x201d;</font></i></p>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. In a supplementary affidavit of discovery sworn by Mr Ganley on 24th July, 2015, Mr Ganley, inter alia, offered an explanation for the general absence of documentation in relation to the Anglo Adriatic Fund in the documentation discovered thus far, provided further detail as to how he had come to lose the Iraq-related computer files, and provided copies of certain further documentation that had lately come into his possession.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. With regard to the Albanian documentation, Mr Ganley indicated as follows: </font> </p>

Given the passage of time since that date, I am not in a position to identify and individually list each and every document in this regard. I further say and believe that it is possible that additional records relating to the fund may remain in the possession of former employees, consultants and/or agents of the fund. However, if this is the case, despite my best efforts, I say and believe that any such documents are not in my power, possession or procurement&#x201d;.[1]</font></i> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[1] The court notes that none of the &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">former employees, consultants and/or agents</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; is identified, that no detail as to the &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">best efforts</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; is provided and that there is a remarkable looseness to the phrase </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;[I]n or around 1997</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; &#x2013; such documentation as has been placed before the court suggests that things &#x2018;got bad&#x2019; for the Fund in Albania sometime around March 1997 but were back on an even keel by November of that year. There is in any event a certain unreality to the suggestion that even widespread civil disorder in Albania would have led to the complete disappearance of documentation relevant to the discovery process. Counsel for RTÉ referred the court, when at hearing, to a document provided in the discovery process which sets out an overview of the Anglo Adriatic Fund and states, inter alia, &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Fund started the voucher collection process in August 1996. It opened collection centres at branches of the Savings Bank of Albania&#x2026;.Collection centres were set up in Tirana, Durres</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [and other metropolitan areas in Albania</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">]&#x2026;.In processing and administering the voucher collection, staff were trained by the Albania America Enterprise Fund. The staff were employed by the Savings Bank of Albania to assist the bank&#x2026;.Proper day-to-day reporting and management structures are in place to ensure that both record keeping and security procedures are in order</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;. This would suggest a relatively dispersed operational structure, an attack on one or more parts of which would still leave others intact, and the records therefrom still available. </font></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">20. With regard to the Iraq-related documentation, Mr Ganley explained matters as follows: </font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;In my Affidavit of Discovery sworn on 10th April 2015, I averred that certain discoverable electronic documents were wiped from a computer system in 2008. In fact, I have now established that documents were wiped from the system not in 2008 but in 2004 and 2005. Specifically, I say and believe that in or around August 2004, the hard drive of the computer belonging to my personal assistant became corrupted and again all of [the] material for the previous year was lost. On both occasions specialist IT consultants were retained to repair&#x2026;[my personal assistant&#x2019;s] computer, but unfortunately, all the material contained on her hard drive was irretrievably lost. I say and believe that some material coming within category (g) was contained on&#x2026;[my personal assistant&#x2019;s computer] hard drive as a consequence, is no longer accessible. At this remove, given the passage of time since this occurred, I am not in a position to identify or individually list what documentation coming within category (g) was lost.&#x201d;</font></i>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">21. The court cannot but note in passing that the events described by Mr Ganley in the last two segments of quoted text are each sufficiently memorable in nature, viz. a loss of files as a result of looting following on a temporary breakdown in civil order in Albania, and the complete wiping of files from a computer (an event of no little significance in the commercial life of any enterprise) that it is difficult to believe that when Mr Ganley approached his first affidavit of discovery, and was focusing so intensely on the events of the past so as to ensure that he complied with his obligations, did not recall or did not think it appropriate to mention why events that would almost certainly yield gaping omissions in the documentation of which he was to make discovery. Moreover, the court must admit to some scepticism that all of the documentation relating to a bid for a telecommunications licence would be contained on the computer of Mr Ganley&#x2019;s personal assistant only. Were there no e-mails sent by him to her or </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">vice versa</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> containing text or attachments of relevance? And can it be that not a single copy of any such e-mail and/or attachment (whether as an attachment or as a saved file) exists on the hard disk of a computer belonging to, or is otherwise preserved, electronically or otherwise, by, for example, Rivada or Ganley International? It just does not ring true of the operations of any commercial enterprise of substance in our Electronic Age that there would be such limited availability of documentation that the loss of saved material on a single hard-disk would mean that all copies of that saved material had thereby been lost forever. The usual problem these days is the reverse: there are so many e-mails that have a nearly identical sequence of previous e-mails recited in the text beneath them and/or which attach the same or slightly variant versions of documents that it is excising replicates from the bundle of documents for eventual use, not finding such replicates, that is often a key challenge in the discovery process. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22. Two further letters written by RTÉ&#x2019;s in-house solicitors to Mr Ganley&#x2019;s solicitors add some further colour to the picture presenting as of end-2015/early-2016, at least so far as RTÉ then perceived matters to be. Thus in a letter of 1st December, 2015, RTÉ writes, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, as follows:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;We have received your letter dated 11th November&#x2026;with some surprise. While it would ordinarily be customary to give you Discovery and documentation as soon as we had complied with our obligations, you know that the reason we are not doing so is the very matter to be argued on our Motion </font></i>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">[now before this Court]</font>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;.We have made it clear that we consider your client&#x2019;s supposed &#x2018;extensive searches of voluminous documentation&#x2019; to have resulted in Discovery which is inadequate in the grossest possible ways.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">As you know the obligation to Discover is one which falls upon the Plaintiff but it is up to you to bring home to him its extent. You know, for example, although you have left out of your Discovery, the more particular Second Part of Category G from the description in your Affidavit, that the circumstances in which the Plaintiff&#x2019;s Iraqi involvement came to an end are of particular importance. Although your client Discovers some very general material, for example, dating from 2003, you produce only six documents dating from 2004 during which most of the relevant events took place. We know, and so does your client, that there were and are many more documents relating to the 2004 matter and you will be well aware from the reasons given for seeking Discovery in the first place what kind of documents must be pertinent. We would go on to say that those that your client has Discovered appear to be a meagre selection of general documents which he hopes might contain some comments might be considered favourable to him. He has clearly made no serious attempt to grapple with the matter.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">We cite this only as an example. His Discovery is gravely deficient, we suspect in every category in which he has made it. The mere fact that the Plaintiff may consider the Discovery onerous or perhaps even unhelpful to his case is not a basis for a failure to make it.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">We first asked you for Discovery on 20 December 2012. It is now December, 2015 and your client still has not addressed it properly. While our position is not that simplistic, this cade involves your client&#x2019;s involvement in a large investment fund in Albania, his role as an alleged advisor to the Latvian government in the 1990s, his proposal allegedly to set up a bank, his controlling interest in one of Europe&#x2019;s largest onshore gas fields, his effort to become involve in a national telecommunications network in Iraq and various other matters. Are we seriously to believe that even in the most extraordinarily [presumably &#x2018;extraordinary&#x2019;] circumstances such enterprises between them could generate a total of 509 documents over a space of many years. We exclude from the Schedule in your Affidavit of Discovery the 108 documents which are alleged to comprise all documents, records, notes and memoranda regarding an interest in six television stations in Central America because we never asked for any Discovery in this category despite the fact that you have made it.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">We would add that we had in the most recent Affidavit got sketchy details of the alleged disappearance of records owing to the corruption of your client&#x2019;s personal assistant&#x2019;s computer. We are amazed that between your Affidavit of Discovery in April 2014 and that sworn in July, you allegedly realised that such a cataclysmic event happened not in 2008 but in 2004 and 2005. We cannot imagine how anyone could possibly get such a thing wrong and we note also that no indication of any kind was given as to the detailed nature of the Iraqi documents alleged to have been lost or of any efforts at any time since to retrieve them. In addition it is now claimed that Anglo Adriatic Fund documents were destroyed by damp\mildew &#x2018;in or around the early 2000s&#x2019; again no details are given just as none are given in relation to the alleged loss of documents of a similar nature in 1996 to 1997.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">If your client is serious about his efforts to make proper Discovery he should have no concerns about cross-examination on the subject. We, however, are greatly concerned in the circumstances, that, as we have earlier pointed out, he should not know what we can prove until he makes a serious effort to engage with Discovery. We have made it quite clear we do not believe he has.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are as anxious as you to bring this case to Trial, but it must be done fairly.&#x201d;</font></i></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">23. It is difficult to imagine a better example of &#x2018;Do as I say, not as I do&#x2019; than that contained in the above-quoted text. RTÉ complains about Mr Ganley&#x2019;s perceived want of compliance with his discovery obligations, and even presumes to take his solicitors to task as to their role as regards ensuring Mr Ganley&#x2019;s compliance with those discovery obligations, at a time when RTÉ itself has completely, and deliberately, failed to comply with its own obligations, pursuant to court order, to make discovery to Mr Ganley. Absent unusual or mitigating circumstances, courts generally take a dim view of non-compliance by a party with a court order, sometimes going so far as to reflect their displeasure in a costs order, sometimes otherwise, sometimes both. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">24. In its letter of 27th January, 2016, RTÉ puts beyond doubt the approach that it is adopting, stating </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;[W]e believe that we have an entitlement to cross-examine your client on the deficiencies in his Discovery. We have made it plain that if your client knows what documents we have which lead us to this conclusion, he will be in a position to tailor his Discovery, as we believe that he has already done, to serve his own ends. For this reason we will not undercut the rationale of our own Motion by giving your client any part of our Discovery at this juncture so we can aid him in the process</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; &#x2013; notwithstanding that there was at the time a court order in place requiring that the discovery which was being refused ought to be made and was required to be made. In this regard, the court found the following exchange, at hearing, between court and counsel for RTÉ to be informative (Day 2, p.103):</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Judge: [C]ould I just ask one question? Usually you would expect somebody like the defendant coming into court and saying &#x2018;I have done everything right and they haven&#x2019;t, so will you please give me the order?&#x2019; But you are coming into court and saying &#x2018;I have done everything right to a point&#x2019;, aren&#x2019;t you&#x2026;?</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Counsel: Well that is true and I have said why.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Judge: Yes.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Counsel: And I have attempted to lodge the papers in court so that the process is frozen.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Judge: Yes. But is that a relevant factor for me to bear in mind?</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Counsel: Well I say yes, just to the extent that the jurisdiction of the court in the matter is as flexible as the requirements of justice require. I say the remedy for a failure to make discovery is primarily to ensure that discovery is then made. I say that I am spiritually, so to speak, clear&#x2026;when I said that I was going to seek to put the matters into court but not to give them to the other side yet and to ask the court&#x2026;to vary its order so that until&#x2026;the Plaintiff was prepared to make proper discovery, that I shouldn&#x2019;t have to inform the Defendant.&#x201d; </font></i></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">25. While the court agrees that the remedy for a failure to make discovery ought generally to be that the court thereafter seeks to ensure that full and proper discovery is made, the court cannot but note that neither in the above exchange nor otherwise at hearing, nor in the submissions or other documentation placed before the court, has RTÉ assuaged the concern prompted in the court by the fact that RTÉ comes to court at this time seeking the full benefit of such discovery as has been agreed while at the same time denying, and hoping for a time to continue to deny, to Mr Ganley, such discovery as RTÉ has been ordered to make. Such an approach cannot stand. Just as a party who comes to equity must come with clean hands, so too, by analogy, a party who comes to court seeking a discretionary relief which will better ensure that right be done to him by another must expect as the quid pro quo exacted by the court for the granting of such discretionary relief that he must do right by that other. To use a colloquial phrase, RTÉ cannot &#x2018;have its cake and eat it&#x2019;; if it wishes to get justice it must also do right. </font>
             <br> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(x) Affidavit of Ms Trish Whelan, Solicitor, RTÉ, of 29th January, 2016.</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">26. Parties often complain about some aspect of the discovery being made by the other side. Parties may sometimes harbour suspicions that they have not been provided with relevant material by the other side. But discovery, being a human process, is inherently likely to be a somewhat flawed process, and courts are conscious of that constant reality. As this Court noted at para. 11 of its judgment last year in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ryanair Limited v. Van Zwol and ors</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IEHC 264, where, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, complaint was made that documents were discovered by way of a third affidavit of discovery which, it was contended, ought to have been discovered by way of a first affidavit of discovery: </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even the most scrupulous of discovery processes &#x2013; and no little scruple is required in the discovery process &#x2013; likely involve some element of inbuilt error. Discovery is a means to an end, not an exercise in perfection</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#x201d; </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27. Counsel for RTÉ indicated agreement with the last-quoted observation at hearing and insisted that what RTÉ is about in this case is not the pursuit of perfection. RTÉ just does not consider that it is getting anything approaching the level of discovery that it considers would render the main trial of the within proceedings to be a fair meeting of arms. However, even with the various deficiencies that the court has referred to above as regards Mr Ganley&#x2019;s approach to discovery thus far, and it has flagged some significant deficiencies, it places no little premium on the fact that Mr Ganley has sworn on affidavit what he can and cannot provide by way of discovery. Swearing to matters in court proceedings is never a matter lightly to be approached and the court&#x2019;s general experience is that it is not lightly approached because people know that trouble can ensue for them from deliberately swearing to something that is false. Moreover, as counsel for RTÉ acknowledged at hearing, there will often be some &#x2018;to-ing and fro-ing&#x2019; in a discovery process as fresh documentation comes to light or is remembered or is belatedly realised to come within the scope of what it has been agreed or ordered shall be discovered; and nobody complains about that because in truth there is nothing to be complained about. But what has tipped the balance and inclined the court to the view that proper discovery has not been made by Mr Ganley to this point of documentation which must be known to him and which is in his power or possession, is the evidence of Ms Trish Whelan, a solicitor for RTÉ, in an affidavit sworn by her on 29th January, 2016. The relevant segment of her affidavit commences at para. 28 and reads as follows:</font> </p>

However, it is worth quoting in some detail the text of that letter. It is a substantial and detailed text which makes clear that Mr Ganley and certain associated persons were very aggrieved by what they considered to be the defamatory material that had been published in respect of them in the Los Angeles Times. The letter is written on the headed notepaper of Addleshaw Goddard, Solicitors, and states, inter alia, as follows:</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;Dear Sir</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Declan Ganley, Liberty Mobile and Guardian Net</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have been consulted by Declan Ganley, Liberty Mobile and Guardian Net in connection with two articles written by your staff writer, T Christian Miller and published by the Los Angeles Times. The first, entitled &#x2018;Iraq: Cellular Project leads to US Inquiry&#x2019; was published on 29 April 2004 and the second, entitled &#x2018;Pentagon Deputy&#x2019;s Probes in Iraq Weren&#x2019;t Authorized, Officials Say&#x2019; on 7 June 2004 (&#x2018;the articles&#x2019;). The articles contain a great many inaccuracies and are seriously defamatory of our clients.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our clients are well known and highly regarded in the telecommunications sector, both in the UK and internationally. The articles are published in this country [the United Kingdom] on the Los Angeles Times&#x2019; website at www.latimes.com and the first article is also published on www.corpwatch.org under the section &#x2018;War Profiteers&#x2019;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">In a nutshell, the articles implicate our clients in the allegedly corrupt behaviour of John A Shaw, the Pentagon&#x2019;s Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for International Technology Security, in connection with the award of contracts in Iraq following the war. They claim that Mr Shaw is being investigated by the FBI. The articles repeatedly name our clients in connection with the activities which they claim are the subject of the investigation and suggest very strong ties between our clients and Mr Shaw thereby tarring our clients with the same brush as they do him. Their clear inference is that our clients were party to Mr Shaw&#x2019;s allegedly corrupt activities.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no truth in the suggestion that our clients have been party to any dishonest or corrupt practice in respect of the award of telecommunications contracts in Iraq or otherwise. Furthermore, Mr Shaw is not under investigation by the FBI. The articles&#x2019; implications of dishonesty and fraud on the part of our clients are entirely false and highly damaging to our clients&#x2019; reputations. Indeed, it is very difficult to think of allegations more injurious to the reputations of a well-respected businessman and his companies. The articles even go so far as to say that the alleged sharp practice may have indirectly caused the deaths in Iraq of many Americans and Iraqis.</font></i> </p>

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The articles taken as a whole and the tenor of suspicion and insinuation in which they are written implicate our clients in highly unlawful and dishonest conduct which has, it is claimed, resulted in lives being lost in Iraq. This is highly damaging to our clients&#x2019; reputations. Indeed, the articles have already resulted in Guardian Net losing a telecommunications contract in Iraq; our client was informed that the CPA [i.e. the Coalition Provisional Authority, the transitional government of Iraq established following the invasion of that country in 2003] told senior executives from a large US corporation that the &#x2018;well had been poisoned&#x2019; by the articles&#x201d;.</font></i></p>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">29. The letter then goes on to demand, </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">, an apology, a retraction and a reimbursement of legal costs. It is clearly not a letter that was lightly sent, and it concerns an episode that had manifestly aggrieved Mr Ganley and certain of his associates very considerably, causing them (the letter alleges) reputational and financial damage. So it is unlikely to be an episode that would be forgotten quickly, if at all. Ms Whelan continues as follows, at para. 29 of her affidavit of 29th January, 2016:</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The letter speaks for itself. It is inconceivable that Mr Ganley can have been unaware, if he was in any way serious, in swearing any of his Affidavits of Discovery, that he had threatened such proceedings. It is difficult to imagine that he would still not be able to recover the letter if he has not always had it. If he could not, it is hard to imagine why he did not include this letter at Schedule II to his Discovery. It makes reference to Los Angeles Times articles which themselves should have been discovered. [In fairness to Mr Ganley, to the extent that there is a suggestion at this point of Ms Whelan&#x2019;s affidavit that discovery was made of neither article, she is wrong; discovery was made of the article of 29th April 2004, thus pointing to some appreciation on his part of the relevance of such documentation to the within proceedings]. They were clearly within his power or possession. No response to the letter has been discovered, nor anything else relating to it, either before or after. Furthermore, it is difficult to see how Mr Ganley would have pursued the matter with his Solicitors without giving him what must at that time have been the extremely extensive documentation in his possession in relation to the whole Iraqi issue. The threatened action concerned public contracts with which Mr Ganley was intimately connected involving two companies in which I believe he may well have had a controlling interest. It is hard to see how the Addleshaw Goddard letter would not have been written without their being supplied by Mr Ganley with relevant documentation to assist them in measuring its terms. It is difficult to see how, in the context of threatened litigation, relevant documents would not have been produced in non-electronic form if they did not already exist in non-electronic form. If, as was indicated in his Second Affidavit of Discovery, such documents as disappeared did so in 2008, they should have been available in the context of the threatened proceedings by Addleshaw Goddard. If they suddenly disappeared in August 2004 within a month or so of the letter being written in July, it is hard to see how this would not have been a memorable event. If it was, it is hard to see how [Mr Ganley]&#x2026;could not at the time of swearing his First Affidavit of Discovery, have remembered what is meant to have happened and the nature of the documents which he had in relation to the termination of the Second Application in relation to Iraqi telecommunications. In any event, it would appear that Mr Ganley is not discovering a document or documents of which he must be aware.&#x201d; </font></i>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">30. It is hard to disagree with Ms Whelan&#x2019;s various assertions; and the inexorable conclusion arises that it seems more likely than not that Mr Ganley has not thus far made discovery of all the documentation of which he ought by now to have made discovery.</font>

Before proceeding to consider some relevant case-law, the court would note the obvious, which is that the rules regarding the content of an affidavit of discovery are not something to be honoured in the breach or brushed to one side; the rules are required to be observed and ought to be observed in whatever form they subsist from time to time. Sometimes the procedural and technical requirements of the superior court rules may seem an inconvenience, even an annoyance. But while those requirements can ever be improved, they cannot be ignored, least of all by the courts. For if the courts do not insist on a reasonably high level of procedural compliance, the level of such compliance will inevitably diminish, resulting ultimately in a reduction of the quality of justice emanating from our legal system. Taking cases to court is not an easy task; a multitude of obligations and pressures arise when bringing motions and making applications; ethical obligations must be complied with and court materials must comply with the rules; clients want their cases heard and relief granted while at the same time minimising legal costs. The use of affidavits offers a means of reconciling, at least to some extent, these manifold objectives and pressures. But the courts cannot be tolerant of efforts that would see the rules of affidavit evidence diluted. They cannot allow non-compliance to such an extent as would render the evidence that is being provided meaningless. Confronted with such non-compliance the courts must seek to remedy such defects and/or to take appropriate punitive measures. In the within case the court does not see the need, at this time, for punitive measures; however, there is the clearest of needs presenting to remedy such defects in the discovery at hand in order that, regardless of eventual outcome, both parties to the within proceedings enjoy that most basic of rights, being a fair trial of the dispute now arising between them.</font>

[2012] 3 IR 528, a case involving various applications concerning discovery, Clarke J. observed, at para. 21, that </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;[T]he basic obligation on any party is to comply, to the best of its ability, with any order for discovery made</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;, adding that &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">a number of ancillary obligations also arise</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;, these being, per Clarke J., at paras. [22]&#x2013;[24]:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;[22] First, where it is likely that the scale of discovery which will be required to be made is significant and, thus, likely to be lengthy and costly, there is, it seems to me, an obligation on a party to consider how best it can meet any likely obligation to make discovery in a way which does not unduly delay the trial of the proceedings and which does not add unnecessarily to the costs likely to be incurred. While it is true that the specific and formal legal obligations of parties are those which are defined in court orders (or agreements between parties concerning discovery which have the same status as a court order) nonetheless, it seems to me that parties have general obligations which go beyond formal compliance with the orders of the court. In the context of the questions which arise in these proceedings it is, therefore, important to note some aspects of those obligations.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[23] Since the decision of the Supreme Court in </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Framus Ltd. v. CRH plc</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;[2004] 2 I.R. 20, it has been clear that the court must pay attention to the principle of proportionality in deciding on the breadth of discovery to be ordered. It is also clear from </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Telefonica O2 Ireland Ltd. v. Commission for Communications Regulation</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2011] IEHC 265&#x2026;(and the cases cited therein) that proportionality can also play a role in relation to the disclosure of confidential information, at least in circumstances where documents are sought to be disclosed which are highly confidential (and, in particular, where the confidence of third parties is involved) and where the relevance of the documents concerned to the case may be at best marginal. It remains, of course, the case that, as Kelly J. pointed out in </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cooper Flynn v. Radio Telefís Éireann</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2000] 3 I.R. 344, the requirement that justice be administered fairly will trump any obligation of confidence in ordinary circumstances so that confidentiality will not, ordinarily, provide a basis for the non-disclosure of materials which are of real relevance to the proceedings.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[24] It also seems to me that proportionality is a relevant consideration when the court has to determine the way in which a party is to comply with its discovery obligations. There is, potentially, an interaction between the speed at which a discovery obligation has to be met, on the one hand, and the costs of complying with discovery obligations, on the other hand. While there may be some absolute limits to the speed at which aspects of the identification and analysis of materials which might potentially be included in a discovery affidavit can be achieved, nonetheless it is likely that the application of additional resources (whether they be human or technological) can speed up the process although sometimes at a not inconsiderable cost. In the ordinary way, it seems to me that a court, in considering the length of time which a party should be given to comply with a discovery obligation, should have regard to what might be considered an acceptable length of time having regard for the need for the case to come to trial with reasonable expedition, but also to the costs that might have to be incurred by greater expedition and to then strike an appropriate or proportionate balance.&#x201d;</font></i></p>

               <ul>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) where it is likely that the scale of discovery to be required is significant there is an obligation on a party to consider how best it can meet any likely obligation to make discovery in a way which (a) does not unduly delay the trial of the proceedings and (b) does not add unnecessarily to the costs likely to be incurred; </font>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">40. The court has been referred to the judgments in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Irish Nationwide Building Society v. Charlton</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Unreported, Supreme Court, 5th March, 1997) in which Murphy J. notes that a solicitor is under a &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">duty to take positive steps to ensure that his client appreciates the extent of the obligation imposed by an order for discovery</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;, and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Balla Lease Developments Ltd. v.

The court does not propose to consider these judgments in any detail as there is no evidence before the court, none at all, that points to any failing on the part of any of the solicitors, or indeed any other professional advisors, to either of the parties to these proceedings, as regards the process of discovery.</font> </p>
             <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) Want of discovery.</font></i> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">41. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sterling-Winthrop Group Ltd v. Farbenfabriken Bayer Aktiengesellschaft</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1967] IR 97 the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants intended to use certain of the plaintiffs&#x2019; intellectual property rights and to pass off the defendants&#x2019; goods as those of the plaintiffs. Affidavits of discovery were filed by the defendants and the plaintiffs made application for further and better discovery. The court has been referred to Kenny J.&#x2019;s overall summary of principle, at 100, but his review of case-law in the following pages which led him to that overall summary of principle is also of interest. First, the overall statement of principle, at 100:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Although the rules of court have never provided for an application by either party for an order that the other party should make a further affidavit of discovery&#x2026;the Courts in Ireland and England have always had power to order that either party should make a further affidavit. Such an order will not be made when the application is based solely on an affidavit alleging that the other party has documents in his possession relevant to the action which have not been disclosed by the first affidavit. The Court will, however, order a further affidavit of documents when it is satisfied (a) from the pleadings, (b) from the affidavit of discovery already filed, (c) from the documents referred to in the affidavit of discovery, or (d) from an admission by the party who has made the affidavit of discovery that the party against whom the order is sought has other documents in his possession relating to the issues in the action which have not been disclosed by the first affidavit. The Court will also order a further affidavit when there are grounds, derived from the documents discovered, for suspecting that there are other relevant documents in the possession of the party who has made the affidavit or where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person making the affidavit of discovery has misunderstood the issues in the case and has, in consequence, omitted documents from it.&#x201d;</font></i>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">42. This conclusion as to applicable principle followed from, albeit that in the actual text of the judgment it preceded, a review by Kenny J., at pp. 100&#x2013;104, of eighty years of case-law, that showed a progressive extension of the grounds on which the court will order a further affidavit:</font>

[(1880) 5 QBD 556], a decision of the English Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Brett said at p.558:-&#x2026;[W]e are of opinion that the rule to be observed is as follows: either party to an action has a right to take out a summons that the opposite party shall make an affidavit of documents: when the affidavit has been sworn, if from the affidavit itself, or from the documents therein referred to, or from an admission in the pleadings of the party from whom discovery is sought, the master or judge is of the opinion that the affidavit is insufficient, he ought to make an order for a further affidavit; but except in cases of this description no right to a further affidavit exists in favour of the party seeking introduction. It cannot be shewn by a contentious affidavit that the affidavit of documents is insufficient&#x2026;.In that case the defendants admitted that they had in their possession the documents of which discovery was sought but contended that they were not relevant and the Court of Appeal refused to order that a further affidavit should be filed.</font></i>

I agree that the party issuing the summons for a further affidavit is bound by the description given in the sources of information mentioned in Jones&#x2026;that is to say, he is bound to a certain extent: I do not think that he would be bound absolutely by every description of their contents if the Court can see, from the nature of them, that the description of them is not or may not reasonably be correct. I do not think that the Court is bound any more on the second summons than on the first to accept absolutely everything which the party swearing the affidavit says about the documents, but the Court is bound to take his description of their nature. The question must be, whether from the description either in the first affidavit itself or in the list of documents referred to in the first affidavit or in the pleadings of the action, there are still documents in the possession of the party making the first affidavit which, it is not unreasonable to suppose, do contain information which may, either directly or indirectly, enable the party requiring the further affidavit either to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary, in order to determine whether certain documents are within that description, it is necessary to consider what are the questions in the action: the Court must look, not only at the statement of claim and the plaintiffs&#x2019; case, but also at the statement of defence and the defendants&#x2019; case&#x2019;.

             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bula Limited v. Crowley</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1991] 1 IR 220, an appeal concerning various motions for discovery, Finlay CJ observes, at 223, that &#x201c;</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">A submission was made on behalf of the defendant Laurence Crowley that these documents had in substance been discovered by McKay and Schnellmann Ltd. against whom the proceedings were not commenced until 1988. This does not, as a matter of principle, in my view, absolve the defendant Laurence Crowley from discovering the documents if they are relevant, and the plaintiffs are entitled to discovery from both the defendants concerned. I would, therefore, order the further discovery of these documents</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#x201d; In other words, the fact that documents have been discovered by one party to an action does not relieve the other party of the obligation to make discovery. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">44. In the within proceedings, having regard to the facts before it at this time, it seems to the court that there is likely documentation of which discovery has not been made by Mr Ganley and of which discovery ought to have been made. For example, the wholesale omissions in the Albanian documentation, the absence of any documentation relating to the proposed establishment of Ganley International Bank in Latvia, the general absence of any documentation concerning the acquisition of a 50 per cent share in an Albanian gas field, the absence of any documentation concerning Mr Ganley&#x2019;s purported role as an advisor on technology and terrorism to the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Club de Madrid</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> group of heads of state and government, and the almost complete absence of documentation relating or referring to Mr Ganley&#x2019;s interest in the contract for a telecommunications network in Iraq back in 2004. To take but one of these examples, it just does not ring true that a tender for a major telecommunications contract would yield discovery of but a single e-mail. This being so, the case being so clearly established for an order for further and better discovery, it seems to the court that the critical question for determination by it is not so much whether there should be an order for further and better discovery but whether the facts establish this to be one of those exceptional cases in which the court should go beyond &#x2018;merely&#x2019; ordering further and better discovery and order that Mr Ganley be cross-examined on his affidavits of discovery.</font> </p>

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;[&#x2026;] The court has a jurisdiction and there is no issue about this, to strike out proceedings or to strike out a defence filed by a defendant where it is satisfied that the extent of the non-compliance with the court&#x2019;s order is such that it is not possible to have a fair trial as a result and of course that may also arise where it appears from the affidavit that some particular documents or some category of documents have been in fact destroyed by the party concerned, whether innocently or whether deliberately in order to interfere with the further conduct of the case.&#x201d;</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">28. Keane CJ then cited the decision of Barrington J. in Murphy v. J Donoghue Ltd [1996] 1 I.R. 123, where he said (at p. 142):</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;[U]ndoubtedly cases may exist where one party may not be able to get a fair trial because of the other party&#x2019;s wilful refusal to comply with an order for discovery. In such cases it may be necessary to dismiss the plaintiff&#x2019;s claim or to strike out the defendants&#x2019; defence and such cases will be extreme cases.&#x2019;</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">29. Dealing then with the defendant's submissions, Ryan J. said in Green Pastures (at p.10):</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;On the application to have the defence struck out, the first defendant submits that if any default on their part had been identified, striking out the defence would not be appropriate in light of </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Campion v. Wat</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2013] IEHC 45. A more appropriate method to query assertions made by the plaintiff on affidavit would be by way of cross-examination. While O. 31, r. 21 RSC gives the court authority to strike out a defence if a party fails to comply with an order for discovery, the jurisdiction is exercised in the most extreme cases. This point was affirmed by the Supreme Court in </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Murphy v. J. Donohue Limited</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1996] 1 I.R. 123 where Barrington J. held at p. 142:-</font></i> </p>

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">This approach is outlined more recently in </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dunnes Stores v. Irish Life Assurance</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2010] 4 I.R. 1, where Clarke J. held at p 8:-</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;I should emphasise that a court has no business in seeking to punish a party who has failed to make proper discovery by interfering with what would otherwise be the proper and fair result of the proceedings. The proper way to deal with a culpable failure of discovery is to direct the consequences to the wrongdoing concerned. If it remains, nonetheless, possible that there be a fair trial, then the court should conduct that fair trial and come to a just conclusion on the evidence and the law. The consequences of any failure to make proper discovery should be in costs or other matters directly flowing from the failure concerned.&#x201d;</font></i></p>

It appears to me from the above authorities that before I could accede to an application to strike out the plaintiff's claim, I would first have to be satisfied that there is an ongoing failure to comply with the discovery order herein, secondly that such failure is clearly deliberate and thirdly the consequence of that failure will be to deprive the defendants of a fair trial. It is certainly true to say that there is at least an ongoing technical failure to comply with the order in the sense that although the plaintiff says he has now produced everything he has, he has not sworn a formal supplemental affidavit of discovery. However, that can presumably be remedied easily and quickly.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">31. If that deficiency is cured, then it is in my view not absolutely clear that there is a continuing failure to comply with the order...&#x201d;.</font></i></p>

Having regard to the facts pertaining to date in the within proceedings, as identified by the court previously above, there is an ongoing failure by Mr Ganley to comply with the agreement as to discovery, it appears to the court that such failure cannot but be deliberate, e.g. the provision of a single e-mail concerning an entire tendering exercise, and certainly if matters go uncorrected it seems to the court that the inexorable result would be to deprive RTÉ of a fair trial. However, it is clear that the courts generally recoil from taking so drastic a step as to grant an order for strike-out where some other avenue remains open to ensuring that there is proper discovery, and in the within proceedings the court considers that such an avenue exists.

                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Unreported, High Court, Clarke J., 23rd April 2008) discovery relies to a large degree on trust. The purpose of the agreement that was reached between the parties hereto was to define the obligations of the parties concerning disclosure of documents, and it was then incumbent on those persons charged with swearing the affidavit of discovery upon whom a trust is placed that they will conscientiously and diligently deal with the task in hand. As Clarke J. pointed out, mistakes can and do happen and they can range from the entirely innocent and understandable to those which might be characterised as blameworthy to a greater or lesser degree. At the other extreme are cases where there has been a deliberate failure to disclose material information. If a party does not fully understand any aspect of the obligation imposed in respect of discovery, for example, with an issue such as privilege, the obligation is to take proper legal advice and to act upon it&#x2026;.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The defendants have strongly urged upon the court that the plaintiffs have not and, effectively, will not make discovery. I am not so satisfied. I note the apology tendered to the Court in respect of the June 2008 discovery and the acceptance on the plaintiffs&#x2019; behalf of the necessity to engage with the defendants and to comply with their discovery obligations. I note the retention of a dedicated panel of Junior Counsel and the additional retention of Price Waterhouse Coopers, chartered accountants, to assist with the e-discovery. I note the assurance given on the plaintiffs&#x2019; behalf that they will abide by any direction of the court as regards ongoing discovery. I take the view that the directions which have been given in respect of the several issues that arise will bring about a situation whereby if complied with, the plaintiffs will have made full discovery&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Johnston v. Church of Scientology (Unreported, Supreme Court, 7th November 2001) Keane CJ in an ex tempore judgment stated:</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;&#x2026;when the trial judge came to deal with the notice of motion requiring that the plaintiff's claim should be struck out because of failure to comply with this order for discovery he quite rightly in my view approached the case on the basis that it was an extraordinarily wide ranging order for discovery and in applying the principles that he did and correctly, in my opinion, he quite rightly took into account the nature of the order of discovery made. The court has a jurisdiction and there is no issue about this, to strike out proceedings or to strike out a defence filed by a defendant where it is satisfied that the extent of the non-compliance with the court&#x2019;s order is such that it is not possible to have a fair trial as a result and of course that may also arise where it appears from the affidavit that some particular documents or some category of documents have been in fact destroyed by the party concerned, whether innocently or whether deliberately in order to interfere with the further conduct of the case. There is no doubt that the courts enjoy such a jurisdiction but the law is stated as follows by Mr. Justice Barrington speaking for this court in the case of Murphy&#x2026;</font></i> </p>
                <ul> 
                 <ul>

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Keane C.J. went on to apply those principles, noting that it was not disputed on behalf of the defendants that they were the principles to be applied. Like the judgment of Barrington J. in Murphy, the judgment of Keane C.J. in Johnston does not appear to contemplate any distinction between a motion to strike out a plaintiff&#x2019;s claim and a motion to strike out a defendant&#x2019;s defence in terms of the principles applicable to each&#x2026; A question arises as to whether a wilful refusal to make discovery is required or whether a negligent failure to comply is sufficient. It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that there would have to be a wilful refusal to make discovery in order for the Court to dismiss the plaintiffs&#x2019; claim&#x2026;.that is not to say that a negligent failure to make discovery, without more, will suffice to warrant a dismissal or strike out. It is also necessary, as the passages quoted above from the judgments of Barrington J. in Murphy and Keane C.J. in Johnston indicate, to consider whether a fair trial can be achieved notwithstanding this failure. As Clarke J. said in Dunnes Stores at paras. 3.5 to 3.6 of his judgment:</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x2018;3.5 I should emphasise that a court has no business in seeking to punish a party who has failed to make proper discovery by interfering with what would otherwise be the proper and fair result of the proceedings.

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.6 It is only if it is proper and appropriate to conclude or infer from the failure to make proper discovery in the first place that the failure concerned was designed for the purposes of not giving access to the other side to relevant information and where it would be appropriate to infer, in turn, from such a finding, a particular view on the issues to which that information refers, that it would be appropriate to allow a failure to make proper discovery to influence the courts decision on the merits of the case&#x2026;&#x2019;.&#x201d;</font></i></p>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">52. First, the deficiencies in Mr Ganley&#x2019;s discovery to date are not attributable to any &#x2018;inadequate handling&#x2019; of matters by any of his advisors. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">53. Second, the court considers that the clear absence of information that must be available (examples of this information have been recited previously above) cannot but be deliberate. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">54. Third, this failure does not appear to the court to be attributable to any want of understanding on the part of Mr Ganley as to his obligations under the discovery process. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">55. Fourth, it is obvious that there has been a complete breakdown in that (wary) trust which is a feature of the typical discovery process. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">56. Fifth, there is no acceptance on the part of Mr Ganley that the discovery process thus far has been deficient and that improvements will be forthcoming. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">57. Sixth, it is clear that the courts generally recoil from striking out a defence for want of discovery; such reluctance must pertain </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">a fortiori</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> where some alternative route of securing proper discovery is available. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">58. Seventh, it appears to the court that notwithstanding such deficiencies as present to this time in Mr Ganley&#x2019;s discovery, it is still possible through the interventions that court will make pursuant to this judgment to ensure that the eventual trial of proceedings will nonetheless be fair.</font> </p>

               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;19. It seems to the court that the following principles of relevance can be identified, inter alia, from the above-mentioned cases&#x2026;</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">II</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cross-Examination on Affidavit of Discovery</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. The administration of justice, as vested by the Constitution in the courts, requires that the courts have the ability to adjudicate fully upon the adequacy and accuracy of an affidavit of discovery&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. There are circumstances in which it may be permissible to cross-examine on an affidavit of discovery&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. The court may exercise a judicial discretion as to whether there may be cross-examination on an affidavit, including an affidavit of discovery&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. Because of the variety of other remedies available with a view to testing matter contained in an affidavit of discovery (e.g. further and better discovery, interrogatories, court inspection) the circumstances in which cross-examination on an affidavit of discovery will be allowed are very rare&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. It is wholly undesirable that, save in the most exceptional cases, the court should be called upon to deal with questions such as the existence or non-existence of a document in circumstances where such a question might impinge to a serious extent on the issues in the action&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Cross-examination on an affidavit of discovery should only be permitted where it is necessary and other remedies (e.g. further and better discovery, interrogatories, court inspection) prove inadequate&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. The unitary trial is in general the mode of disposal of a case, unless a preliminary issue of law or a modular issue will genuinely help in disposal and not cause irremediable prejudice&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. Departure from the basic rule of a unitary trial must be genuinely helpful in terms of saving court time, minimising costs and truly helping, not hindering the ultimate trial&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. Examination of a party or of a witness prior to trial, should not become the trial itself&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. As with interrogatories, it is difficult to conceive of any circumstances where a party would be granted leave to engage in a general cross-examination on an affidavit of discovery in advance of a trial: any such procedure is properly to be confined to trial&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">21. As with interrogatories, any order allowing cross-examination on an affidavit of discovery should not only be directed rarely but should always be specifically directed to one or more particular issues&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">22. Interrogatories and discovery and replies to particulars are methods whereby a fair appraisal of opposing claims may be made prior to trial. Their existence depends on the probability of their being of assistance, relevance to the claim as pleaded and the requirement that oppression through use of pre-trial procedures is avoided&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>

             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) Background.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">61. By notice of motion of 18th March, 2016, Mr Ganley seeks an order pursuant to O.19, r.27 of the Rules of the Superior Courts, as amended, striking out paras. 8&#x2013;10 of RTÉ&#x2019;s Defence delivered on 15th November, 2012. Ultimately, this application arises from the fact that, in his statement of claim in the within defamation proceedings, Mr Ganley does not identify the specific words that he claims are defamatory of him. Rather, it is pleaded in a general way, at para.3 that RTÉ &#x201c;published words that were defamatory of and concerning [Mr Ganley]&#x201d; and then refers to a transcript of the entire broadcast which is attached to the statement of claim. Because of this, RTÉ, by notice of particulars dated 4th July, 2012, requested Mr Ganley to identify precisely what words employed in the impugned programme bore or were understood to bear each of the defamatory meanings pleaded at para. 6 of the statement of claim. The notice for particulars dated 4th July, 2012, was responded to by replies dated 23rd April, 2013. Again, however, Mr Ganley failed to identify any specific words contained in the impugned &#x2018;Prime Time&#x2019; programme which are defamatory of him, and also failed to identify or particularise any specific words alleged to bear any of the meanings pleaded at para. 6 of the statement of claim. Rather, Mr Ganley asserts, somewhat vaguely, at para. 2 of the replies, that &#x201c;the programme in its totality was defamatory&#x201d; and points to various segments of the programme and all the words uttered therein; it is helpful to recite these in some detail:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>

                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">repeats the programme in its totality was defamatory of [Mr Ganley]&#x2026;but, inter alia, in the following regard,</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) the title &#x2018;Citizen Ganley&#x2019; a copy of the hit movie &#x2018;Citizen Kane&#x2019; invoking an image of an utterly ruthless and single-minded businessman. The studio is dimly lit and the presenter is seen wearing a black dress creating a morbid atmosphere. The RTÉ studio is not usually lit this way for other episodes of the same programme.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) the use of an actor dressing in his bedroom at the opening section, creating the impression this person is </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">when it was not, hiding the person&#x2019;s face, it also serves to create doubt in the mind of the viewer from the outset and an obvious recreation of the famous opening scene in the mafia movie &#x2018;The Pope of Greenwich Village&#x2019; to create the impression</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;[Mr Ganley]</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was somehow not a legitimate business man.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) deploying malignant music throughout the programme, this creates the impression that </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">is involved in mysterious and clandestine activities. For example, much of the &#x2018;Citizen Ganley&#x2019; programme backing sound track comes from &#x2018;The Bourne Ultimatum&#x2019;, a movie about a rogue CIA agent who murders people around Europe while on the run. The same frightening &#x2018;mood music&#x2019; is also a feature in &#x2018;Assassin&#x2019;s Creed&#x2019; a mass market video game.</font></i> </p>

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(f) deploying a map shot accompanied with malignant music throughout the programme to show</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;[Mr Ganley&#x2019;s]</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> movements around Europe, a tactic used in the Bourne Identity movie by CIA officers attempting to track the rogue homicidal agent on the loose.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(g) using academics to discuss the macro economic circumstances at work in Latvia at the time</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;[Mr Ganley]</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was working there and making references to how exporters, as </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was then, would be subject to mafia hits. There is a clear insinuation that </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">would have to have ties with the mafia if doing business exporting through those ports. Insinuating he was either involved in or protected by organized crime.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(h) disputing that </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was ever a paid advisor to the Latvian government when </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">did not so claim</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;.[Mr Ganley]</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> only ever claimed to be an advisor to certain members of the Latvian government, which he was.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) filming a spokesperson for the Prime Minister who states the Prime Minister does not remember </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">being an important advisor to him, knowing very well this is not what </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">claimed.</font></i> </p>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">63. On the day that the notice for particulars of 4th July, 2012, was served, Mr Ganley issued a motion for judgment in default of defence against RTÉ. On the return date for that motion, RTÉ was ordered to deliver its defence within four weeks. Consistent with that order, RTÉ delivered its Defence on 15th November, 2012, still without having received replies to particulars identifying the words that were defamatory or that bore the meanings alleged by Mr Ganley. Unsurprisingly perhaps, RTÉ asserts in its Defence, at para. 4, that Mr Ganley </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;fails to identify any specific words contained in the programme which are alleged to be defamatory of </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">[RTÉ]&#x2026;.[and]</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has also failed to identify or particularise any specific words which are alleged to bear each or indeed any of the alleged meanings pleaded at paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim&#x201d;</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">. Indeed, in para 2 of its Defence, RTÉ &#x201c;</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">denies that </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">[RTÉ]&#x2026;</font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;. In para. 10 of its Defence, RTÉ states that &#x201c;</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Without prejudice to the foregoing, if, which is denied, the broadcast is defamatory of </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley]&#x2026;[RTÉ] </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">pleads that the sting of the words in the programme, taken as a whole, was that [Mr Ganley]&#x2026;had a tendency to make false or exaggerated claims in respect of business or other matters</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;. As touched upon elsewhere above, RTÉ then proceeds in some detail, at sub-paras. (a)&#x2013;(g) of para. 10, to identify a detailed list of matters that it will rely upon in its defence in this respect. By notice for particulars dated 8th January, 2013, Mr Ganley sought particulars of the facts grounding each of the pleas made in the Defence that Mr Ganley has a tendency to make exaggerated claims. Detailed replies to particulars were furnished on 23rd April, 2013. Accordingly, Mr Ganley can have been left with no illusion as to the case that RTÉ would be making at the trial of the action and the factual matters which RTÉ would be relying upon.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">64. As it happens, the reply to RTÉ&#x2019;s defence was also delivered on 23rd April, 2013. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the reply states that &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. In response to paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;[RTÉ&#x2019;s]</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Defence</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, [Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">contends that the alleged facts (which are denied) pleaded in those paragraphs do not sustain or support a plea of justification&#x201d;, and &#x201c;3. </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[RTÉ]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">is not entitled to seek to prove the truth of the allegations at paragraph 8, 9 and 10 of its Defence, in support of a plea of justification of meanings which </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">has not pleaded</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#x201d; In an affidavit sworn in support of Mr Ganley&#x2019;s Strike-Out Application #2, Mr Rooney, a partner in the firm of solicitors acting for Mr Ganley in the within proceedings, elaborates further on this aspect of matters, stating &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">At paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of its Defence</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, [RTÉ]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">has sought to prove the truth of the meanings of the defamatory words complained of by Mr Ganley by reference to other alleged facts which are unconnected with the words in the broadcast complained of by </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[RTÉ]&#x201d;. Given that Mr Ganley has never expressly identified the words alleged to be defamatory of him, there is an intrinsic flaw to this last-quoted assertion. But, that aside, is the assertion otherwise correct? The court turns now to consider the respective assertions of the parties in this regard before moving on to a consideration of applicable case-law and principle.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">65. Mr Ganley maintains that RTÉ is not entitled to seek to prove the truth of the facts alleged in paras. 8 and 9 of the Defence in support of a general plea of justification; his basis for this assertion is that the facts pleaded in the said paragraphs are different facts from those which are contained in the broadcast and do not therefore meet the so-called &#x2018;sting&#x2019; of the publication (and, in particular, do not meet the separate and distinct defamations that Mr Ganley contends that the impugned broadcast contained). When it comes to para. 10 of the Defence, Mr Ganley&#x2019;s complaint is that the impugned broadcast is not capable of bearing the meaning which RTÉ contends it to bear, viz. that Mr Ganley is a fantasist who has a tendency to make false and exaggerated claims in respect of business and other matters. Consequently, Mr Ganley contends, for RTÉ to prove the truth of the facts alleged in paras. 10(a)&#x2013;(g) of the Defence would not afford it a successful plea of justification. All this being so, Mr Ganley now contends that, having regard to the meaning of the allegations contained in the impugned broadcast and to the criteria identified in O.19, r.27 of the Rules of the Superior Courts (1986), as amended, the court ought now to strike out paras 8&#x2013;10 of RTÉ&#x2019;s Defence.

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) RTÉ acknowledges that the second part of para 8 of its Defence is more closely related to the allegation made by Mr Ganley at para. 6(g) of his statement of claim but that, again, the meaning it contends for is a viable alternative meaning to that pleaded by Mr Ganley in respect of the relevant portion of the broadcast; </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) RTÉ does much the same in para. 9 of the Defence, pleading what it maintains is the real meaning that the impugned words are reasonably capable of bearing and which it intends to prove as substantially true (being that Mr Ganley, it is claimed, frequently exaggerated his role vis-à-vis the Latvian Government during the early stages of Latvia&#x2019;s recent re-establishment of its independence); </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) as to Mr Ganley&#x2019;s contention that for RTÉ to prove the truth of the facts pleaded in paras. 10(a)&#x2013;(g) of the Defence would not afford RTÉ a successful plea of justification, RTÉ, while asserting its right in any event to plead its Defence as it has, points to the fact that in, inter alia, the replies to particulars of 23rd April, 2013, quoted above, Mr Ganley himself states that &#x201c;&#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The entire programme was crafted with a slant&#x2026;to create the clear impression in the minds of the viewer that </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Mr Ganley]&#x2026;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was a shady individual&#x2026;.[a] fantasist who made up business dealings</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;, and thus that Mr Ganley himself acknowledges that the impugned programme has wider and more general meanings than those pleaded by Mr Ganley in his statement of claim; and </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v) RTÉ maintains that the Prime Time programme possesses a common &#x2018;sting&#x2019; which is that Mr Ganley is a person with a tendency to make exaggerated claims in respect of business or other matters, that this allegation and common sting can be proven to be substantially true and that it (RTÉ), in its Defence and replies to particulars, has, consistent for example with the decision of the Court of Appeal in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lucas-Box v. Associated Newspapers Group plc and ors</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1985] EWCA Civ J1030&#x2013;7, fully particularised the matters upon which it intends so to prove, that it has identified the alternative meanings which it intends to demonstrate as being the meanings that the impugned words bore, which meaning it maintains it will be able to prove are true in both substance and fact.[1]</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[1] In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lucas-Box</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the plaintiff claimed that certain newspaper articles were defamatory of her, one for alleging that she lived with a ruthless killer and had been involved in serious criminality, the other for alleging that she had knowingly assisted terrorists and lied about her actions. After their defences had been served, the defendants sought and were granted leave to amend their defences so as to rely on a plea of justification. It was indicated that the extent of the justification would be that Ms Lucas-Box was careless in her choice of friends; later it was put in the form that she knew the man she lived with to be a terrorist. Unsuccessful in her initial appeal against, inter alia, the orders giving leave to amend, Miss Lucas-Box was thereafter successful before the Court of Appeal, that court holding that when a defendant seeks to rely upon a defence of justification, s/he must make it clear to the plaintiff exactly what defamatory meaning is claimed to have been justified. In the course of his judgment, Ackner L.J. observes at 7 that &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is axiomatic that the function of pleadings is to define the issues between the parties, so that both the plaintiff and the defendant know what is the other side&#x2019;s case and thus everyone, counsel, judge and jury, are able to focus upon the real nature of the dispute. Although to some it may seem a startling observation, we can see no reason why libel litigation should be immune from ordinary pleading rules</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;, later adding, at 15, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;[T]he court should not, in our judgment, have hesitated in ordering the defendants so to plead their case that the plaintiff knew quite clearly what the defendants were purporting to justify. However, we would go even further and say that whatever may have been the practice to date, in future a defendant who is relying upon a plea of justification must make it clear to the plaintiff what is the case which he is seeking to set up. The particulars themselves may make this quite clear, but if they are ambiguous then the situation must be made unequivocal</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#x201d; In Ireland, one can see the application of Lucas-Box logic in the ex tempore judgment of the Supreme Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Leech v. Independent Newspapers (Ireland) Ltd.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Unreported, Supreme Court, 10th February, 2006) in which a plea of alternative justification was struck out by the Supreme Court, not on the basis that the plea was impermissible, but on the basis that no material facts had been pleaded in support of it. (The decision appears to have been premised on an acceptance of the availability of the plea, at least in principle). The Supreme Court also ordered that the defence could be amended by the re-insertion of the plea of alternative justification, supported by particulars of the facts on which it was based and a pleading as to the meanings the impugned words were claimed to have. </font></p>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">67. It seems to the court that there are at least three ways in which the parties to defamation proceedings may disagree about the proper meaning of an impugned text. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">68. First, a defendant may claim that a publication does not convey the meaning pleaded by the plaintiff but seeks to justify a different meaning that is capable of arising from the impugned publication. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">69. Second, a defendant may argue that the multiple meanings of an impugned publication are not distinct but have a common sting, and that proving the truth of one or more aspects of the common sting will justify the entire publication. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">70. Third, a defendant may contend that an impugned publication conveys one or more meanings in addition to that of which complaint is made, with the result that the plaintiff&#x2019;s reputation is not damaged by the imputation of which the plaintiff makes complaint. Although not so starkly presented in the argument at hearing, the first and second ways mentioned above are the ways in which RTÉ seeks to ground its defence to the within proceedings. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">71. A defendant to defamation proceedings is entitled to justify a common &#x2018;sting&#x2019; derived from parts of an impugned publication of which a plaintiff does not complain, insofar as the said parts are relevant to the meaning of the words that are complained of and to the &#x2018;sting&#x2019; of the alleged defamation. The bar for judicial intervention as regards the form of such defence as is advanced in this regard is properly set high, not least but not only because a man ought not generally to be unduly ham-strung by courts or court procedures in how he wishes to defend himself from such attack as is made on him by way of litigation. Maher, in his learned text The Law of Defamation (2011), observes as follows:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;5-21 A defamatory statement may contain many allegations and imputations. The plaintiff may cite several, and the plaintiffs in pursuit of damages often claim there are numerous extremely damaging meanings in the published words. A defendant pleading a defence of truth is not obliged to agree with the plaintiff&#x2019;s contentions as to what meanings the published statement bears, and then go on to seek to prove the truth of the meaning the words can convey to a reasonable person. However, the defence of truth will not succeed if the court or jury finds the words capable of bearing a materially more serious meaning than the meaning which the defendant has justified. The defendant, therefore, takes a significant risk where he or she elects to prove the truth of a particular meaning, knowing that the plaintiff&#x2019;s meaning is capable of being held to be a reasonable one&#x2026;.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">5-23 The bar for judicial intervention in this context is set relatively high. In </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hamilton v. Clifford</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [[2004] EWHC 1542&#x2026;] Eady J. considered that he should intervene only when a meaning contended for was so implausible that it held the potential for a perverse outcome. Walsh J. in </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quigley v. Creation</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [[1971] IR 269] said a judge &#x2018;should not withhold the matter from the jury unless he is satisfied that it would be wholly unreasonable to attribute a libellous meaning to the words complained of&#x2019;. In </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Berezvsky v. Forbes</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [[2001] EWCA Civ 1251&#x2026;] the exercise was characterised by Sedley L.J. in the following way:</font></i> </p>
                <ul> 
                 <ul>
                  <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;The real question in the present case is how the courts ought go about ascertaining the range of legitimate meanings. Eady J. regarded it as a matter of impression. That is alright, it seems to us, provided the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant. Such an exercise is an exercise in generosity not in parsimony. It is why, once fairly performed, it will not be second guessed on appeal by this court: the long stop is the jury.&#x2019;</font></i>
                 </ul> 
                </ul> 
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">5-24 Where the defendant denies that the words complained of carry the meaning the plaintiff contends for them, he or she must set out what meaning the defence attributes to the words. This is termed a Lucas Box meaning, from the 1986 judgment of the Court of Appeal in Lucas Box v. News Group Ltd [[1986] 1 WLR 147], in which it was held that as the normal rules of pleading required the parties to define the issues between them, a defendant relying on a plea of justification had to make clear the meaning to be attributed to the words that he was seeking to justify. Usually the defence will argue that, in their ordinary meaning, the words carry a less serious charge than the meaning being put forward by the plaintiff.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">5-25 A plaintiff is entitled to select from the defamatory statement the parts of which he complains, provided they can be separated from the rest for that purpose. As O&#x2019;Connor L.J. stated in Polly Peck v. Trelford [[1986] 1 QB 1000 at 1032]:</font></i> </p>

                  <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;Where a publication contains two or more separate and distinct defamatory statements, the plaintiff is entitled to select one for complaint, and the defendant is not entitled to assert the truth of the others by way of justification.&#x2019;</font></i>

                </ul> 
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">5-26 However, a defendant may agree that the words selected and complained of by the plaintiff do not amount to a distinct allegation but share their meaning with other parts of the statement, and that the statement and the &#x2018;sting&#x2019; it conveys should be seen as a whole:</font></i>

                  <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;Whether a defamatory statement is separate and distinct from other defamatory statements contained in the publication is a question of fact and degree in each case.

When it comes to identifying the &#x2018;sting&#x2019; of a publication for the purposes of the defence of truth and in the specific context of whether one is dealing with a collection of distinct allegations or, alternatively, various allegations which, taken cumulatively, amount to a general statement about a plaintiff, Cox and McCullough in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Defamation Law and Practice</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> (2014), make the following observations of interest, at 159-61: </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;General and Specific Allegations</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[5-37] A further area of concern in terms of assessing what the sting of the publication is, for the purposes of the defence of truth, is whether a publication is making a specific allegation or allegations about a defendant, or is instead making a general comment on his or her character. In other words, is the publication merely a collection of distinct allegations, or do these various allegations, taken cumulatively, amount to a general statement about the plaintiff.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[5-38] The answer to this question will be relevant in determining what must be proved as far as the defence of truth is concerned. So, for example, if a publication refers to a plaintiff committing three known bank robberies, it may be seen as containing three separate allegations, all of which have to be proved, or alternatively as containing one single allegation, namely that the plaintiff is an inveterate and dangerous criminal, in which case that single allegation will have to be proved. Clearly also, the answer to the question of whether the publication contains a general or a specific allegation will be relevant in determining the type of evidence that the defendant will be allowed to adduce in support of his or her plea of truth.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[5-39] A finding that the imputation involves a general allegation of bad character against the plaintiff will lead to a number of significant consequences, most of which tend to be beneficial from the defendant&#x2019;s standpoint:</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> First, it will mean that, whereas the defendant must prove more than the truth of a single specific allegation contained in a publication, equally, s/he may not have to prove the truth of every allegation contained therein provided that the general sting is established.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Secondly, it will mean that the defendant will be permitted to adduce a good deal of evidence unconnected to any specific allegations within the publication that may have the effect of seriously reducing the reputation of the plaintiff in the eyes of the jury, and may thereby impact both on its finding on liability and more especially on the quantum of damages awarded. On this basis, under the former law, evidence of specific acts of misconduct when admitted in support of a plea of truth were taken into account in mitigation of damages, notwithstanding the general rule excluding such material for that purpose.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [Court Note: This last sentence refers to the fact that where there is a failed plea of justification, it has always been the law that a jury is entitled to take into account what it regards as having been true, if it considers that what it has found is true is appropriately mitigatory of such damages as a plaintiff would otherwise fall to receive.]</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> However, as noted elsewhere, the 2009 Act has increased the ability of a plaintiff to adduce general evidence of misconduct outside of the context of a plea of truth, so that this consideration is now of less importance for a defendant.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [Court Note: As the within proceedings are not brought under the Act of 2009, this last point appears not to benefit RTÉ].</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> It seems clear that, just as it will not be possible to refer to general matters in order to prove a specific allegation against a plaintiff, so also it is not possible to prove a general allegation by reference to one instance of misconduct. So, for example, just as an allegation that the plaintiff was involved in a well-known bank raid will not be proved by evidence that s/he had criminal tendencies, so also a general allegation that the plaintiff was dishonest will not necessarily be proved by reference to one single instance of robbery. This is because it is not a foregone conclusion that a person who commits an offence once thereby bears the characteristics of a person who habitually commits this kind of offence, and it is a dangerous business for a publisher to make such a connection.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [Court Note: Another example would be to describe a journalist as a &#x2018;libellous journalist&#x2019; simply because s/he has at one time been found to have committed defamation.] </font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Moreover, whereas it may be possible to justify a general allegation of bad character by reference to events that have occurred since publication, this will not be possible where what is at stake is a specific allegation in respect of a specific event.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [Court Note: As the court understands matters, all of the events raised by RTÉ occurred before publication.]</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Finally, as we have noted, the plaintiff is normally entitled to sue for whatever specific allegations s/he wishes and to ignore any allegations in the publication; however, this type of extraction is not possible where the whole publication contains a general and common sting pleaded by the plaintiff.&#x201d;</font></i></p>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">76. </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was a case arising from newspaper reportage concerning a textile enterprise that would later feature in one of the great corporate scandals of the Thatcher Era in the United Kingdom. Among the plaintiffs were Mr Asil Nadir, who would subsequently flee to Northern Cyprus, following the collapse of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, returning to the United Kingdom two decades later to face successful prosecution for various theft offences. This case preceded that eventual collapse and involved a libel claim arising from allegations of what might broadly be described as &#x2018;corporate mis-governance&#x2019; that were made in a trio of articles published in the Observer newspaper during 1983 and to which varying objection was taken by the individual plaintiffs. The defendants pleaded fair comment and justification, the particulars of which tended to support the whole of the three newspaper articles, including assertions in the latter two of which no complaint was made. The plaintiffs applied to strike out those particulars which supported assertions of which they did not complain. The application was dismissed by the master, dismissed on appeal to the judge in chambers and dismissed again on appeal to the Court of Appeal. In the course of his judgment, O&#x2019;Connor L.J., at 1020-21 identifies a number of principles of note in the context of the application now presenting:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;[1] The first principle is that where a plaintiff chooses to complain of part of a whole publication, the jury is entitled to see and read the whole publication: this is unchallenged and has been the law for well over 150 years. What use is the jury permitted to make of the material now in evidence?</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> There is no doubt that they can use it to provide the context to the words complained of when considering whether any, and if so what, defamatory meaning is disclosed. A classic example of the context deciding the meaning of words to be different to their face value meaning is found in Thompson v. Bernard (1807) 1 Camp. 47, a slander action where the plaintiff complained that the defendants said of him: &#x2018;Thompson is a damned thief; and so was his father before him; and I can prove it.&#x2019; The evidence was that the defendant added: &#x2018;Thompson received the earnings of the ship, and ought to pay the wages.&#x2019; Lord Ellenborough CJ directed a non-suit on the ground that it was clear from the whole conversation that the words did not impute a felony, but only a mere breach of trust.</font></i> </p>

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2] The second principle is that where a publication contains two distinct libels, the plaintiff can complain of one and the defendant cannot justify that libel by proving the truth of the other. The difficulty with this apparently self-evident proposition is in deciding whether the two libels are indeed distinct in the sense that the imputation defamatory of the plaintiff&#x2019;s character in the one is different from the other.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[3] The third principle is that it is for the jury to decide what the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of is.

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[4] The fourth principle is that the trial of the action should concern itself with the essential issues and the evidence relevant thereto and that public policy and the interest of the parties require that the trial should be kept strictly to the issues necessary for a fair determination of the dispute between the parties.&#x201d;</font></i></p>

This aspect of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has assumed a certain importance in the within proceedings because the court has been invited by counsel for the plaintiff to rely, inter alia, on the decisions of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Templeton and of the High Court of Australia in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chakravarti </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(considered below), decisions which rely in part on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Brembridge</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, a decision of the English courts, as having been rightly decided, whereas in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it was realised and acknowledged that </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Brembridge</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> had been wrongly decided, and there has been no retreat from that conclusion by the English courts in the years since </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> itself was decided.

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">At all material times Barstaple returned two members to Parliament. From 1836 to 1841 the plaintiff acted as election agent to Mr Hodgson, one of the members, who was a Conservative. From 1841 to 1847 he was agent to the two sitting members, both Conservatives, Mr Hodgson and Mr Gore. At the election of 1847 Hodgson and Gore decided to fight for seats independently. The plaintiff refused to act as agent for Hodgson and, when Gore withdrew, himself entered the lists as a candidate. In the result the plaintiff was elected to one seat in the Conservative interest and the other seat was gained by the Liberal. At the election of 1852, the plaintiff and Sir William Fraser fought the seats in the Conservative interest and were both returned, but in the following year they were unseated for bribery by their agents. A commission was appointed to inquire into the election and acquitted the plaintiff of all personal cognizance of the bribery. In 1863 one of the sitting members died, and the plaintiff and another were candidates at a by-election. It was during the run-up to that election that the article was published by the defendant in the newspaper. One can infer that the article was a full-blooded attack on the plaintiff to try and demonstrate that he was wholly unsuitable to act as a member for Barnstaple. It said that he had been kicked out of the House of Commons for bribery, and charged him with base desertion of his old client and benefactor Hodgson. The paragraph in the article which formed the basis for the plea in the first count in the statement of claim read:</font></i> </p>

                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The defendant entered a general plea of not guilty. The defendant then wished to enter a long plea of justification&#x2026;.The gravamen of the pleas was that the omission of the words from the passage complained of had altered the sense and meaning of the passage, and he then went on to plead that the meaning of the words in their context was that the plaintiff had been guilty of bribery and of base desertion of his old client and benefactor Hodgson. As I read the judgments in the three reports (and there are certain differences in what is reported) it was accepted that the article as a whole would be before the jury, including the passage complained of, unexpurgated. Again as I understand the case, it would remain open to the defendant to justify the meaning put upon the alleged defamatory words in the statement of claim, but the court held that the plea of justification as drafted should be struck out on the ground that it was embarrassing. Byles J. is reported as saying, 12 WR 878, 879-880:</font></i> </p>

                 </ul> 
                </ul> 
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is necessary to transpose the facts of Brembridge&#x2026;into modern times. Today we have the requirements of R.S.C., Ord. 82, r.3, which requires a defendant to give particulars of the facts and matters relied upon where a defence of justification or fair comment is pleaded. In cases where the plaintiff relies on the natural and ordinary meaning of words and pleads a false innuendo, the defendant is entitled to justify the words in any meaning that it is open to the jury to find that the words bear, and I do not see why the defendant should not plead that in their context the words are true. Assume for a moment that the sentence in Thompson v. Bernard [a slander case]&#x2026;has been published as a libel, and the plaintiff complained solely of the words &#x2018;Thompson is a damned thief;&#x2019; it would be an astonishing thing if the defendant were unable to plead that in their context the words were true in substance and in fact, and give particulars of the facts alleged in the rest of the sentence, namely that the plaintiff had received the proceeds of the ship and failed to pay the wages. The reason for this is that quite plainly in their context the sting is not that the plaintiff was a thief, but that he had behaved discreditably in taking the proceeds of the voyage and not paying the crew.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">I do not think that a plaintiff is permitted to use a blue pencil upon words published of him so as to change their meaning and then prevent the defendant from justifying the words in their unexpurgated form. It seems to me that this is exactly what the plaintiff in Brembridge&#x2026;succeeded in doing, because I think that a jury might well have concluded that the passage as published in its natural and ordinary meaning meant that Brembridge was a corrupt, unreliable, heartless man unfit to be a Member of Parliament, as opposed to the innuendo relied upon which I have set out earlier in this judgment.</font></i> </p>

                  <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;correct, because in that case a portion of a newspaper article being set forth in the declaration, with an innuendo, the defendant endeavoured to shew that if the whole article was taken, the plaintiff would have had a different cause of action, and he sought, by his plea, to set out the whole article, and, so, to justify it as true in fact. That was a matter utterly irrelevant to the question at issue, whether he had published the libel charged in the declaration. The Court of Common Pleas refused to allow the plea.&#x2019;</font>

The several defamatory allegations in their context may have a common sting, in which event they are not to be regarded as separate and distinct allegations. The defendant is entitled to justify the sting, and once again it is fortuitous that what is in fact similar fact evidence is found in the publication.&#x2019; (I think he means in the publication itself).&#x2019;</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">What is said here is that that principle can be applied and the sting of the article is promiscuity generally. It is submitted that it would be very difficult for the plaintiff, when her statement of claim comes to be prepared, to make any complaint about this particular allegation which could not equally be made about the other allegations contained in the same article. In those circumstances the Polly Peck principle applies and, notwithstanding that the defendants may not be able to prove the particular affair complained of, they will be able to adduce evidence which will justify the sting of the article and the sting of that statement on the footing, I suppose, that it is not more defamatory to have an extra-marital affair with one person rather than another in the circumstances of this case.</font></i> </p>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the important role of the jury in defamation cases is an aspect of those decisions which has a very real resonance in the context of an application to strike out parts of the defence in a defamation action. As mentioned above, as a matter of principle, if an article is capable of bearing an alternative meaning to that contended for by the plaintiff in a defamation action, then the defendant ought to be and is entitled to have that meaning considered by the jury, provided of course that the impugned article is capable of bearing the alternative meaning. The court includes the last proviso because it is ever a function of the judge in defamation proceedings to decide that an article is incapable of bearing a particular meaning and that a matter need not go to the jury. But once it is capable of bearing that meaning it is a matter for the jury to decide whether in fact it bears that meaning.</font>

The decision of the Court of Appeal in Williams is best seen, and was later described by Ralph Gibson LJ in Bookbinder (considered below), at 650 as &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">an example of the application of established principle to the widely varying circumstances of particular cases</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;. In that case the alleged defamation was that a prominent Welsh Rugby international player had abused his amateur status by writing a book for money and so was guilty of so-called &#x2018;shamateurism&#x2019;. The defendants pleaded justification, and conflicting interpretations of the applicable sporting rules were advanced, with the trial judge suggesting to the jury that the plaintiff&#x2019;s interpretation was correct in terms that, to borrow from the later judgment of Stephenson LJ in the Court of Appeal, at 106, &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">gave them </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[the jury</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">] little room for rejecting his view unless they left common sense behind them and sacrificed simplicity for some improbably complicated alternative</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;.

Indeed this is effectively acknowledged at p.649 of the judgment of Ralph Gibson LJ where he states that &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">In my view, on the essential question as to the possible meanings of the words used in this case, those cases [including, inter alia, Khashoggi]&#x2026;provide little if any assistance, and this is not surprising because the relevant principle applicable in this case is not in issue between the parties and the application of the principle by the court to one set of facts can rarely be of direct assistance in applying it to different facts</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;.</font> </p>

In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bookbinder</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the defamation proceedings arose from a public speech given by the well-known Conservative Member of Parliament and sometime Cabinet Minister, Mr Norman Tebbit (now Lord Tebbit), during the course of a by-election held in West Derbyshire back in 1986. In his speech, Mr Tebbit stated, inter alia, that &#x201c;The £50,000 spent on printing anti-nuclear statements on county schools stationery was a &#x2018;damn fool&#x2019; idea. I hope that Councillor David Bookbinder has also told the Russians of Derbyshire&#x2019;s nuclear-free policy. If not, it is arguable that he has lost £50,000 on this damn fool idea on school notepaper&#x201d;. An attempt in the course of the action for defamation that was later brought by Mr Bookbinder to plead as justification that Mr Bookbinder had squandered funds in a number of other unrelated matters was struck out on the basis that the clear impression formed of the words used was that the ordinary man would regard the defamation (if any) arising in the impugned words to be limited to the spending of the stated sums on the stated project as opposed to anything broader.

Even where a defendant has published two distinct libels about a plaintiff the law permits the plaintiff to complain of one only, and to have that issue decided, and the law does not permit that defendant to justify the one of which complaint is made by proving the truth of the other. Nor does the law permit a defendant to lead evidence of particular acts of misconduct on the part of the plaintiff in mitigation of damages where the defendant has failed to justify the libel complained of: see Speidel v.

If the court is to say that these words, by their own force and in that context , may properly be held to contain a general charge of squandering public money, then it seems to me that we would be very close to holding that it is open to a jury, at least with reference to a person holding elective office and of known political views, to find that any specific charge against him of wrongdoing, based upon specific stated facts, imports a general charge of preceding similar wrongdoing which may be justified by different specific facts&#x2026;.</font></i>

                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2026;courts in England and Australia have sanctioned a practice of permitting a defendant to plead a meaning different from that contended for by the plaintiff and then justifying that different meaning.</font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[7] The authority for this practice is found in the judgment of O&#x2019;Connor LJ in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> where his Lordship said:</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;In cases where the plaintiff selects words from a publication, pleads that in their natural and ordinary meaning the words are defamatory of him, and pleads the meanings which he asserts they bear by way of false innuendo, the defendant is entitled to look at the whole publication in order to aver that in their context the words bear a meaning different from that alleged by the plaintiff. The defendant is entitled to plead that in that meaning the words are true and to give particulars of the facts and matters upon which he relies in support of his plea, as he is required to do by RSC, O82. It is fortuitous that some or all of those facts and matters are culled from parts of the publication of which the plaintiff has not chosen to complain.</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Where a publication contains two or more separate and distinct defamatory statements, the plaintiff is entitled to select one for complaint, and the defendant is not entitled to assert the truth of the others by way of justification.</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whether a defamatory statement is separate and distinct from other defamatory statements contained in the publication is a question of fact and degree in each case. The several defamatory allegations in their context may have a common sting, in which event they are not to be regarded as separate and distinct allegations. The defendant is entitled to justify the sting, and once again it is fortuitous that what is in fact similar fact evidence is found in the publication.</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">What I have said in the context of justification can be applied by a parity of reasoning to fair comment, subject to what I say at the end of this judgment.&#x2019;</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[8] With great respect to his Lordship, such an approach is contrary to the basic rules of common law pleadings and in many contexts will raise issues which can only embarrass the fair trial of the action. Leaving aside technical pleas such as pleas in abatement, defences are either by way of denial or confession and avoidance. A defence which alleges a meaning different from that of the plaintiff is in the old pleading terminology an argumentative plea of not guilty. Under the principles of pleading at common law, it could tender no issue and would be struck out as embarrassing. Under the modern system, articulating an alternative meaning could conceivably make explicit the ground for denying a pleaded imputation. But it would be only in such a case that a defendant&#x2019;s plea of a new defamatory meaning might be supportable as a plea which prevents the plaintiff being taken by surprise. A plea of justification, fair comment or qualified privilege in respect of an imputation not pleaded by the plaintiff does not plead a good defence. It is immaterial that the defendant can justify or otherwise defend the meaning which it attributes to the publication. In our view, the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> defence or practice contravenes the fundamental principles of common law pleadings. In general it raises a false issue which can only embarrass the fair trial of the actions. This was the view of the Court of Common Pleas in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Brembridge v. Latimer</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Brembridge</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Byles J., a common law judge of great authority, said:</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;The law is plain that, if you wish the dispute the sense given to the words in the libel, you must do so by the plea of not guilty, and, if you wish to justify, you must confess and avoid Now, the issue raised by these pleas is plainly calculated to prejudice the plaintiff, who has a right to have the charge of &#x2018;treachery&#x2019; tried, and not to be compelled to take part in an irrelevant inquiry.&#x2019;</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[9] A similar view was taken by Blackburn J., another great common law judge, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Watkin v. Hall </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[(1868) LR 3 QB 396] where his Lordship said [at 402]:</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x2018;I think the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Brembridge v Latimer</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> correct, because in that case a portion of a newspaper article being set forth in the declaration, with an innuendo, the defendant endeavoured to shew that if the whole article was taken, the plaintiff would have had a different cause of action, and he sought, by his plea, to set out the whole article, and, so, to justify it as true in fact. That was a matter utterly irrelevant to the question at issue, whether he had published the libel charged in the declaration. The Court of Common Pleas refused to allow the plea.&#x2019;</font> </p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;In the present case, however, the allegation that the plaintiff despises Jews is not reasonably capable of being treated as other than a distinct charge. It is obviously different, for instance, from the allegation that he despises women. It is true that many of the allegations in the passage quoted in par 5 of the statement of claim are variations on or illustrations of a theme: namely that the plaintiff indulges in the politics of hatred. They are specific and severable allegations nonetheless. It is important to note that the plaintiff is not suing on all the words set out in par 5. In par 6 it is made clear that only the allegation about Jews is sued on. The defendant on the other hand, as is made plain by the opening words of par 7 of the amended statement of defence, wishes to prove that all the words set out in par 5 of the statement of claim are true. That is not permissible, because of the limited nature of the plaintiff&#x2019;s complaint.&#x2019;</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [11] This passage highlights what we regard as the fundamental defect in the reasoning in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. Cooke J. rejected the notion that the defendant can take severable parts of a publication each containing defamatory imputations, link them together, and give the publication a meaning at a sufficiently high level of abstraction to subsume the meanings of the severable parts. That is, a defendant cannot take part of an article that wrongly alleges that the plaintiff has convictions for dishonesty and a part that imputes that the plaintiff has defrauded shareholders, assert that the article means that the plaintiff is dishonest, and then justify that meaning, perhaps by proving that the plaintiff had in fact defrauded the shareholders. On that hypotheses, it would be outrageous if the defendant could obtain a finding that the article was true in substance and in fact plainly when it was not. Yet that is the sort of finding that must result from applying the central proposition of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. That proposition is that [per O&#x2019;Connor LJ at 1032]:</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x2018;The several defamatory allegations in their context may have a common sting, in which event they are not to be regarded as separate and distinct allegations. The defendant is entitled to justify the sting.&#x2019;&#x201d;</font></p>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">, that necessarily makes it a decision that is, with every respect, less attractive as a precedent for this Court to place reliance upon. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">88. It seems to the court that at this juncture the following observations might usefully be made, based on its consideration of applicable law and authorities to this point. </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2013; first, fairness of procedure requires that each party to defamation proceedings must have an equal opportunity to present its case within the particular context of an impugned publication. </font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2013; second, parties in defamation disputes often disagree about what a publication means. Dealing effectively with such disagreements is important in arriving at a system of defamation litigation that is equitable, efficient and expeditious. </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2013; third, if a plaintiff contends for a particular meaning, it is generally necessary, if justice is to be done, that a defendant be allowed to plead an alternative meaning which the defendant intends to justify; of course this alternative meaning must be confined to the impugned publication, subject to context. Otherwise a plaintiff&#x2019;s legal advisors could, through cleverness or clumsiness, secure an unwarranted procedural and substantive advantage by pleading one or meanings which do not properly or fully convey the true meaning of the impugned publication. </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2013; fourth, the tort of defamation is intended to provide a remedy for a person whose reputation has indefensibly been injured by the publication of something disparaging of that person&#x2019;s good name; in essence, it &#x2018;boils down&#x2019; to determining what an impugned publication means. </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2013; fifth, it follows that the most effective and fair approach to the defence of truth must be focused on the substance of an impugned publication. </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2013; sixth, the importance of the defence of truth is such that a failure by the law to deal with it well will inevitably increase technical arguments about meaning, diverting attention unhelpfully from an impugned publication to the lawyer&#x2019;s pleading of the alleged imputations. </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2013; seventh, plaintiffs in defamation actions face lesser hurdles than in other civil actions, such as, for example, the tort of malicious falsehood; as a result the defences to defamation assume a commensurately greater importance, as does the judicial approach to them being such that a defendant is not unduly and unnecessarily hamstrung in defending himself to the optimal extent possible from an allegation of defamation. </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2013; eighth, Chakravarti, by focusing on the basic rules of common law pleadings is perhaps, and with every respect, vulnerable to criticism for not acknowledging sufficiently that defamation is different from some other civil litigation and that its special character may justify a particular approach to pleading (à la </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">); the practices of past times must ever yield to the necessities of the prompt and frugal disposition of litigation. </font></p>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">90. Ms Cooper Flynn brought a libel action against RTÉ and other defendants following the airing of television reportage which alleged that she had induced the third defendant and others to participate in a tax evasion scheme being facilitated by the bank where Ms Cooper Flynn then worked. The case attracted some prominence because, inter alia, Ms Cooper Flynn had subsequently been elected a member of Dáil Éireann. The first and second defendants had at an earlier stage been granted non-party discovery of documentation that related to the alleged scheme, but with the names of the scheme participants excised. They returned to court seeking the disclosure of the names which had been withheld at that earlier stage. All of the defendants had pleaded justification and it was argued, inter alia, for the bank that such a plea ought not to have been entered if the defendants did not have the evidence to support that plea at the time of making their defence (and that, in effect, discovery should not now be used to make good on that plea). This argument was rejected by Kelly J., who considered that the fact that there was a plea of justification in circumstances where it was not suggested that such plea had been improperly made did not dis-entitle the first and defendants from seeking support for their case in such documents as were revealed in the course of discovery. In reaching this conclusion, Kelly J endorsed the observation of Lord Denning MR in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Assoc. Leisure v. Assoc. Newspapers</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1970] QB 450, 456 (with both conclusion and observation later being endorsed by Macken J. in Desmond (considered below) that &#x201c;Like a charge of fraud, [counsel] must not put a plea of justification on the record unless he has clear and sufficient evidence to support it&#x201d;. </font> </p>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">92. In three editions of the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">News of the World newspaper</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, articles and leaders were published alleging that a number of programmes by the well-known television investigative reporter, Roger Cook, were fakes. In the ensuing libel proceedings, the defendant sought to justify the allegation that the programmes were fakes and also to assert that the impugned words in their context were capable of meaning that a separate programme called &#x2018;The Connection&#x2019;, with which Mr Cook had no connection, was likewise faked. Eady J., in the High Court, found that the impugned allegations concerned Mr Cook&#x2019;s programme (&#x2018;The Cook Report&#x2019;) and held that the defendant could not therefore make reference to &#x201c;The Connection&#x201d;. On appeal, the decision of Eady J. in this regard was reversed. What makes the case of some interest in the context of the within proceedings is that the Court of Appeal was referred, inter alia, to two cases in which the courts had found that two separate libels had been contained in the same publication or series of publications but concluded that in the instant case the court was confronted with two separate allegations that were capable together of forming one single allegation which, subject to any considerations of case management, the appellants should be entitled to seek to justify. Per Latham LJ, at paras. 24&#x2013;28:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;24. [We have been] referred to two cases in particular in which the courts have considered that two separate libels have been contained in the same publication or series of publications. The first is United States Tobacco International Inc v. British Broadcasting Corporation [1998] EMLR 816 which was referred to by the judge [i.e. Eady J.] in his judgment. This was a decision of this court [i.e. the Court of Appeal] in 1988. It related to the broadcast of a programme about a substance known as oral snuff which was considered by the government to present a danger to health. The programme asserted that the substance was carcinogenic and that the plaintiffs were in breach of an agreement that they had entered into with the Department of Health restricting the marketing of the product and forbidding its sale to young people. The plaintiff issued proceedings complaining of the allegation of a breach of the agreement. The defendants sought to plead and justify as part of the issues before the court the assertion that oral snuff presented a health risk. The plaintiffs were prepared to agree a statement which would go before the jury to the general effect that there was a significant body of medical opinion which considered the substance to be carcinogenic.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">25. Purchas LJ and Nicholls LJ held that although there was a connection between the two allegations, in that the reason for the agreement was the existence of what the Government perceived to be a health risk, nonetheless the defendant should not be permitted to plead and justify the health risk allegations. They both considered that a just determination of the dispute did not require a resolution of the health issue. Nicholls LJ said that its only relevance, in any event, was to damages. Russell LJ considered that they were in any event two separate and distinct allegations, and that therefore the defendant should not be permitted to raise the allegation about which no complaint had been made by the plaintiffs.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">26. The second case is Cruise v. Express Newspaper plc [1999] QB 931. The plaintiffs complained of an article which made serious allegations about their private life, and included defamatory comments about their adherence to the Church of Scientology. The defendants sought to justify the allegations relating to the Church of Scientology, even though those were no part of the plaintiffs&#x2019; complaint. The judge struck out the defence in so far as it sought to justify the allegations in relating to the Church of Scientology. On appeal, this court upheld the judge. Brooke LJ, in his judgment with which the other members of the court agreed, concluded that the &#x2018;sting&#x2019; about their characters of which they complained was totally distinct from the &#x2018;sting&#x2019; that the article contained about their adherence to the Church of Scientology. Even though those allegations were clearly bound up in the other allegations, so that the whole of the article had to go before the jury, he concluded at page 955f:</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;The judge was in my judgment correct to hold that this libel action should not be permitted to get out of control by allowing the defendant to justify or plead fair comment in respect of a quite separate and distinct sting, if indeed it be a sting at all, of which the plaintiffs make no complaint.&#x2019;</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">27. Accordingly Mr Milmo submits that, in the present case, the parts of the articles which refer to &#x2018;The Connection&#x2019;, and its consequences for the respondents, constitute a separate and distinct &#x2018;sting&#x2019; which should not be permitted to divert the court from consideration of the real issue, namely the question of whether or not the appellants can justify the allegations in relation to The Cook Report.</font></i> </p>
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">28&#x2026;.Whether or not the appellants are wise to seek to expand the meaning of the articles in the way they do is a matter for them. But the meaning for which they contend seems to me to be one which is clearly capable of being understood by the ordinary reader. It follows that this is not a case where the defendants seek to assert and justify a separate sting; two separate allegations are capable together of forming one single allegation which, subject to any considerations of case management, the appellants should be entitled to seek to justify.&#x201d;</font></i></p>
               </ul>

             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">93. Latham LJ indicated, at para. 44 of his judgment, that he saw in each of US Tobacco and Cruise &#x201c;simply an application of the second </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> principle&#x201d;. It will be recalled from the consideration of </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> above that this second principle was identified by O&#x2019;Connor LJ, at 1020-1 in the following terms: &#x201c;The second principle is that where a publication contains two distinct libels, the plaintiff can complain of one and the defendant cannot justify that libel by proving the truth of the other. The difficulty with this apparently self-evident proposition is in deciding whether the two libels are indeed distinct in the sense that the imputation defamatory of the plaintiff&#x2019;s character in the one is different from the other.&#x201d; Latham LJ continues, at paras 46&#x2013;47:</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;46. How then does the second Polly Peck principle apply to our case? The answer to my mind is plain. The defamatory allegations concerning respectively the Cook programmes and The Connection manifestly have a common sting. They are accordingly not to be regarded as separate and distinct. Why, then, should the appellants not rely on either to justify that common sting?</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">47. As I understand Mr Milmo&#x2019;s argument, it is that a second allegation cannot properly be introduced for the purposes of justification under the common sting principles unless, taken together, the allegations can be said to advance a wholly general charge &#x2013; in Khashoggi of promiscuity, here of fakery. That argument, to my mind, unnecessarily glosses the authorities and would too narrowly circumscribe the scope of the substantive defence of justification. It would, for example, prevent a defendant who alleged of a claimant that he had committed three murders, in the event that the claimant chose to sue only in respect of one, relying by way of justification on the other two. Mr Milmo would, I think, submit that nothing short of an allegation that the claimant is a serial killer could found a defence on this basis. I would reject the argument.&#x201d;</font></i></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">94. This Court would respectfully agree with the assessment of Latham LJ that, in truth, all that was before the court in Carlton Communications was an application of the second </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Polly Peck</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> principle. And insofar as Carlton Communications involved an application of that principle, the judgment of the Court of Appeal in that case is indicative of how Mr Ganley&#x2019;s application to strike out portions of RTÉ&#x2019;s defence ought now to be disposed.</font>

Desmond is a libel action that arose out of a newspaper allegation that Mr Desmond, a prominent businessman, had made certain payments to former Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey. It is focused more on the mechanics of pleading justification than on issues of principle presenting. In the course of her judgment, Macken J., in the Supreme Court, noted that it appeared that the defendant was raising a plea of alternative justification, then continued, at 764:</font> </p>

                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;A plea of justification is particularly important, having regard to the nature of the obligations imposed in that regard, for the law makes it very clear, as Kelly J. stated in Cooper Flynn&#x2026;citing Lord Denning MR in Assoc. Leisure v. Assoc. Newspapers [1970] 2 QB 450 at p.456:-</font></i> 
                <ul> 
                 <ul>
                  <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;Like a charge of fraud he (counsel) must not put a plea of justification on the record unless he has clear and sufficient evidence to support it.&#x2019;</font>
                 </ul> 
                </ul> 
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am satisfied that counsel would not put a plea of justification other than in accordance with their obligations in that regard, since the case-law also makes it clear that a plea of justification, simpliciter, is a mere repetition of libel, and ordinarily, material facts supporting a plea of justification should be included in the defence as delivered (McDonagh v. Sunday Newspapers Ltd [2005] IEHC 183&#x2026;.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even allowing for a modified form of justification which counsel for the defendant now appears to contend for, it is axiomatic that there is an obligation on a party pleading justification to remain at all times in possession of all the evidence, including notes which go to support the plea, as well as all the meanings contended for, at the time of the delivery of the defence. A failure to do so in my view may well constitute, depending on the circumstances, negligence, even gross negligence on the part of the party invoking such a plea who fails to ensure that the evidence is in fact maintained, at least to the expiry of a limitation period.&#x201d;</font></i></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">96. Subject to and notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no departure in Desmond from the fundamental principles, now considered by the court at some length, as to the pleading by a defendant of the truth of one or more alternative meanings of an impugned publication to that or those claimed by the plaintiff. Moreover, as the court noted when considering Cooper Flynn above, the decision in Desmond, though it enjoys the natural respect which all utterances at Supreme Court level enjoy, does not really advance the resolution of the application now before the court as the court understands there to no suggestion of any impropriety on the part of counsel for RTÉ as regards the plea of justification made by and for their client. </font>

These were defamation proceedings in which the defendant newspaper company entered a defence which, in effect, asserted that an impugned newspaper article bore the meaning alleged by the defendant, not the meaning alleged by the plaintiffs, and that the meaning which the defendant stated the article to bear was true both in substance and in fact. More particularly, the plaintiffs pleaded that an article published by the defendant meant that they were guilty of armed robbery; the defendant sought, by reference to the text of the impugned article, to defend merely the proposition that the plaintiffs were suspected by An Garda Síochána of committing serious crimes. Commenting in this regard, Hardiman J., observed as follows, at pp. 10&#x2013;12 of his judgment:</font> </p>
             <ul>

                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;It was&#x2026;denied that the article bore the meanings alleged in the statement of claim or any meaning defamatory of the plaintiff. There was then a pleading that if the respective plaintiffs were identified by the publication then &#x2018;the same are true in substance and in fact in their true meaning, but not in the meanings pleaded in the statement of claim&#x2019;.</font></i> 
                <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a most unusual pleading. The learned trial judge subsequently held, correctly in my view that it did not constitute a recognisable plea of justification&#x2026;.</font></i> </p>

The particular difficulty that presented in Bradley was that the defendant in that case pleaded a meaning which the impugned article was simply incapable of bearing. In the within case RTÉ pleads alternative meanings which the impugned broadcast, it seems to the court, is at least capable of bearing. Which, if either, of RTÉ of Mr Ganley is correct as to the proper understanding of the impugned broadcast is not a matter for this Court to decide and on which it expresses no view. All it would note in the context of the within application is that what RTÉ seeks to do here is radically different to what the defendant in Bradley was seeking to do.

Is it possible to distil some key principles from the foregoing analysis of case-law that are of assistance in resolving the application now before the court to strike out segments of RTÉ&#x2019;s defence?

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A. General.</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1] Where a claimant complains that words are defamatory of him in their natural and ordinary meaning, the defendant is entitled to justify those words in any meaning which those words are capable of conveying to a reasonable man.

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[3] A defendant is entitled to justify a common sting derived from parts of a publication, taken as a whole, of which the claimant does not complain, insofar as they are relevant to the meaning of the words complained of and to the sting of the alleged libel. The claimant is not entitled to use a blue pencil on the words published of him so as to change their meaning and then prevent the defendant from justifying the words in their unexpurgated form.

(The jury can use the whole publication to provide the context to the words complained of when considering whether any, and if so what, defamatory meaning is disclosed. What other use can be made depends on the nature of the material and on the defences put forward by the defendant); </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) where a publication contains two distinct libels, the plaintiff can complain of one and the defendant cannot justify that libel by proving the truth of the other. (The difficulty with this proposition is in deciding whether the two libels are indeed distinct in the sense that the imputation defamatory of the plaintiff&#x2019;s character in the one is different from the other); </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) it is for the jury to decide what the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of is.

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[8] The function of pleadings, including defamation proceedings, is to define the issues between the parties, so that both the plaintiff and the defendant knows what is the other side&#x2019;s case and thus everyone, counsel, judge and jury, are able to focus upon the real nature of the dispute. (Lucas-Box). </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[9] A defendant who is relying upon a plea of justification must make it clear to the plaintiff what is the case which he is seeking to set up. The particulars themselves may make this quite clear, but if they are ambiguous then the situation must be made unequivocal. (Lucas-Box). </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[10] The defence is not entitled to advance a plea which falls so short of justification in the context of what is the meaning of the article as a whole in terms of where it stands. (Bradley). (It will be recalled that the particular difficulty that presented in Bradley was that the defendant in that case pleaded a meaning which the impugned article was simply incapable of bearing).</font> </p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[11] The bar for judicial intervention is set relatively high. (In Hamilton, Eady J. considered that he should intervene only when a meaning contended for was so implausible that it held the potential for a perverse outcome. Walsh J. in Quigley said a judge &#x201c;should not withhold the matter from the jury unless he is satisfied that it would be wholly unreasonable to attribute a libellous meaning to the words complained of&#x201d;. In Berezevsky, the court&#x2019;s role was characterised by Sedley L.J. as &#x201c;an exercise in generosity not in parsimony&#x2026;.[O]nce fairly performed, it will not be second guessed on appeal&#x2026;the long stop is the jury.&#x201d;)</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[12] A court should not step in to defend a cause of action in defamation if it considers that what is before it is a case in which the plea of justification might, not would, succeed.

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[13] Like a charge of fraud, counsel must not put a plea of justification on the record unless s/he has clear and sufficient evidence to support it. (Assoc Leisure, Cooper Flynn, Desmond).</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">[14] It is axiomatic that there is an obligation on a party pleading justification to remain at all times in possession of all the evidence, including notes which go to support the plea, as well as all the meanings contended for, at the time of the delivery of the defence. (Desmond).</font></p>

             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v) A Three-Fold Test.</font></i> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">100. Following on the foregoing, what key questions might a court usefully ask of itself when presented with a justification plea by reference to an alternative meaning and, as here, an associated application to strike out parts of the defence? It seems to the court that three such questions might usefully be asked. First, is the alternative meaning contended for by the defence capable of arising from the publication? If the meaning is entirely incapable of arising, then the meaning cannot be argued by the defence. Second, does the defence meaning arise from a separate and distinct allegation in the impugned publication about which the plaintiff does not complain? If it does, the defence meaning cannot be argued. So, for example, an allegation about a speeding offence cannot be answered by proving the truth of a separate and distinct allegation concerning murder. However, great care is required in this regard in order to ensure that a plaintiff is not allowed to sue on snippets that distort the true meaning that an impugned publication can reasonably be argued to bear. Third, are proper particulars of fact provided that are capable of supporting the defence? If there are no particulars capable of establishing the alternative meaning, then that meaning cannot be argued by the defence. The answers to the three questions just posed must respectively be &#x2018;yes&#x2019;, &#x2018;no&#x2019; and &#x2018;yes&#x2019; if the pleaded alternative meaning is to be allowed by the court to be aired at trial. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">101. A possible fourth question, aimed primarily at maximising the efficient despatch of proceedings, might be whether the alternative meaning is not substantially different from and not more injurious than the plaintiff&#x2019;s contended meaning. The critical, and not sole, difficulty with this fourth question, and which inclines the court to the view that it is not appropriate that such question be asked, is that it could see a defendant, for reasons of efficiency, suffering the injustice of being prevented from arguing a defence which might have succeeded before a jury, and ultimately the doing of justice, not the relentless pursuit of efficiency, must be the pole-star by which the courts navigate through proceedings. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">102. In the context of the within proceedings, the answers reached by the court, by reference to the facts before it, to the three questions posed are respectively &#x2018;yes&#x2019;, &#x2018;no&#x2019; and &#x2018;yes&#x2019;.</font> </p>
             <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi) Application of Principle.</font></i> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">103. Mr Ganley is effectively seeking, through his application to strike out elements of RTÉ&#x2019;s defence, to engage in &#x2018;blue pencilling&#x2019; of the type which case-law points to as objectionable, complaining of narrow aspects of the impugned RTÉ broadcast but objecting to RTÉ&#x2019;s seeking to justify that broadcast by reference to such alternative meaning as RTÉ reasonably contends it to be capable of conveying to a reasonable man. Notably, however, and although the form of RTÉ&#x2019;s defence is not dependent on such acknowledgement, Mr Ganley does in the course of his pleadings acknowledge that the impugned broadcast asserts generally (and rightly or wrongly) that he displays a disregard for the truth and is a fantasist when it comes to descriptions of his business affairs. The issue between the parties is whether RTÉ&#x2019;s defence can range beyond the &#x2018;blue pencilled&#x2019; parameters of para. 6 of Mr Ganley&#x2019;s statement of claim. It seems to the court that the impugned broadcast can reasonably be contended as having conveyed to a reasonable viewer the generalised themes that Mr Ganley has shown a general disregard for the truth and is a fantasist when it comes to descriptions of his business affairs. It follows that RTÉ must therefore, by reference to the above-stated principles, be allowed to plead the alternative meanings that it contends for and to seek to justify what it contends is the purported common &#x2018;sting&#x2019; of the impugned broadcast. Consistent with, inter alia, Lucas-Box, RTÉ has fully particularised the alternative meanings which it intends to demonstrate as being the meanings that the impugned broadcast bore, which meanings it maintains it will be able to prove are true in both substance and fact. Mindful that the bar for judicial intervention in this area is set relatively high and that the court&#x2019;s role ought to be and is, to use the terminology of Berezvsky, &#x201c;an exercise in generosity not in parsimony&#x201d;, the court must therefore decline to accede to Mr Ganley&#x2019;s application to strike out the impugned elements of RTÉ&#x2019;s defence at this time.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">VII. Conclusion</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">104. The court returns to the various reliefs sought by the parties at this time and indicates the orders that it is satisfied to make, following on its analysis of matters in the preceding pages.</font> </p>
             <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) Mr Ganley&#x2019;s Strike-Out Application #1.</font></i> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">105. By notice of motion of 30th April, 2015, Mr Ganley seeks an order striking out RTÉ&#x2019;s defence for failure to comply with the High Court Order for discovery made on 4th February, 2015. The court declines to accede to this application. However, the court will order that RTÉ comply forthwith with the said High Court order. In doing so, the court is alive to RTÉ&#x2019;s contention that for it to make discovery in accordance with the said order at this time may disadvantage it in terms of any cross-examination of Mr Ganley on his affidavits of discovery sworn hitherto. But discovery invariably brings with it the risk that the party making discovery may suffer some disadvantage thereby and RTÉ has in truth done no more than voice a generalised concern of possible disadvantage should it comply with the order of 4th February, 2015. The court notes too that it does not seem to it that the deficiencies in Mr Ganley&#x2019;s discovery thus far, and there have been deficiencies, justify the court in seeking to fashion some form of ad hoc process that departs greatly from the typical discovery régime. If anything, it seems to the court that its role, when there are demonstrable departures by a party from its discovery obligations, ought, at least in the first instance, to be to seek to remediate matters so as to restore the carefully calibrated equilibrium of the existing discovery regime, rather than accede to further departures from same. </font> </p>
             <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) RTE&#x2019;s Discovery and Cross-Examination Application.</font></i> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">106. By notice of motion of 7th May, 2015, RTÉ seeks a variety of orders, including: </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) an order permitting RTÉ to file in court the Affidavit of Discovery sworn by Ms Katie Hannon for RTÉ, with the schedules to the said affidavit to be sealed until further directions or orders are made by the court as to the release of the schedules to Mr Ganley or otherwise, </font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) an order for further and better discovery (coupled with an order directing Mr Ganley to identify such relevant and necessary documents as were in his possession and power along with an explanation as to when he parted with them and what has happened to them), </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) an order granting RTÉ leave to cross-examine Mr Ganley in respect of all issues arising from the Affidavits of Discovery sworn on 10th April, 2015, and 27th August, 2014, and </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (iv) an order dismissing Mr Ganley&#x2019;s claim for want of prosecution and/or failure to make proper discovery. </font></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">107. As to (i), the court declines to grant this relief, not least though not only because it seems to the court that its role, when there are demonstrable departures by a party from its discovery obligations, ought generally to be to seek to remediate matters so as to restore the carefully calibrated equilibrium of the existing discovery regime, rather than accede to further departures from same. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">108. As to (ii), in the hope that it may yet reduce the amount of cross-examination that is required and because it is preferable in any event that discovery should proceed as it generally does to the greatest extent possible, the court will make such order. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">109. As to (iii), given the deficiencies that appear from the factual evidence before the court to exist in Mr Ganley&#x2019;s discovery thus far, and mindful that discovery is not an exercise in perfection (though conscious that it is not perfection but mere compliance with standard discovery obligations that is being sought in the within instance) the court will make such order. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">110. As to (iv), notwithstanding the deficiencies that appear to present in Mr Ganley&#x2019;s discovery to this time, given the reliefs to be granted under items (ii) and (iii), the court declines to grant at this time the order sought at (iv). </font> </p>
