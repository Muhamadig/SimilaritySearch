             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Judgment of Mr. Justice Clarke delivered the 24th February, 2017.</font></b> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Introduction</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1.1 It is not, I think, an exaggeration to say that the common law jurisdictions of Ireland and the United Kingdom have struggled with the implementation of the costs regime required by the Aarhus Convention and the relevant European Union measures adopted to give effect to it in European law (being, originally, Art. 10a of Directive 85/337/EEC as inserted by Directive 2003/35/EC but now Art. 11 of the codified Directive 2011/92/EU). </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.2 This appeal concerns certain issues relating to the amount of costs which can be awarded against the applicant/appellant (“Mr. Klohn”) having regard to such European law as may be applicable in all the circumstances of the case. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.3 It is important to record that, when a date was fixed for the conduct of the oral hearing in this appeal, the Court received a request from Mr. Klohn in which he sought that the appeal be considered solely on the papers. The respondents (“the Board”) indicated that they did not have any objection in principle to that course of action provided that they were not in any way prejudiced by the absence of an oral hearing. In those special and unusual circumstances the Court formally sat at the time which had been fixed for the oral hearing but simply indicated that it was proposed to consider the written submissions and determine whether it would be possible to come to a just conclusion without an oral hearing. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.4 The Court has concluded, and I agree, that it is necessary, in the context of this appeal, to refer a number of questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) for its opinion. In those circumstances I did not consider it necessary, in order that justice be done between the parties, that there required to be an oral hearing. However, a number of aspects of this appeal require some brief comment. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The Written Submissions</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">2.1 The Constitution in Article 34.1 places a very high value indeed on justice being administered in public. In the past written submissions filed by the parties in the context of an appeal to this Court might reasonably have been regarded as representing an outline of the oral submissions to be made subsequently. However, increasingly, written submissions have come to form an independent part of the process and it frequently is the case that, so far as at least some aspects of an appeal are concerned, counsel are content to rest their case on what is set out in the written submissions. Thus what is said in written submissions has increasingly come to be seen as a substantive part of the case made on appeal.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.2 In those circumstances the Court has arranged that the public may have access to written submissions (subject to appropriate exceptions consistent with any relevant requirement of law concerning privacy). (See Practice Direction SC15 – Written Submissions of the 7th October, 2013).</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.3 It is, therefore, important to emphasise that, even where, exceptionally, this Court is content to deal either with the entirety of an appeal or some aspect of an appeal or matter arising on an appeal without an oral hearing, it remains the case that there is public access to the argument addressed in respect of the issues which arose so that justice can, therefore, be properly said to have been administered in public. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.4 In passing it is appropriate to note that applications for leave to appeal to this Court are now, under the provisions of the Court of Appeal Act, 2014 (“the 2014 Act”), permitted to be determined on the papers and without an oral hearing (see s.7(1) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 as inserted by s.44 of the 2014 Act). In such a case the notice of application for leave and any respondent’s replying notice are published so that the public can become aware of the issues raised. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.5 However, the fact that it may be possible to comply with the requirement that justice be administered in public without always having an oral hearing does not mean that such a course of action is desirable, at least in the vast majority of cases. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The Advantage of an Oral Hearing</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">3.1 To an outsider it may sometimes be considered that oral hearings add to the time and expense of litigation. While there may be a superficial attraction to the argument in favour of that proposition, experience has shown that it will rarely be the case that there is a significant saving in judicial resources. Indeed, this appeal is a very good case in point. The Court obviously did not have to sit to hear oral argument and the time which the members of the panel assigned to hearing this appeal would have spent on that oral hearing was, of course, saved. However, it is important to recognise that the time spent in court is only a fraction of the total time spent by judges working on any individual case. That is particularly so in the case of appellate courts where the evidence and materials on which the case is to be decided are normally to be found only in the record of the case as it was conducted at first instance. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.2 There can be no doubt that, even though the Court ultimately decided that the issues in this case required to be referred to the CJEU, the time which the Court had to spend in considering and deliberating on the issues was significantly greater than the time which it might have been anticipated would have been required to conduct the same task after an oral hearing. It is almost inevitably the case that issues become much clearer as a result of an oral hearing. Sometimes issues drop away entirely because of argument or questioning from the Court. Even where maintained issues may become refined and a greater measure of agreement between the parties may result from oral debate or questioning in circumstances where the same level of agreement may by no means have been apparent from written submissions. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.3 Where disagreement remains it is almost always the case that the differing positions of the parties emerge with greater clarity after oral debate and questioning from the Court.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.4 Thus the time saved during the Court’s deliberation stage will almost always be at least equivalent to the time spent at the oral hearing. The overall amount of judicial time spent on a particular appeal is not, therefore, increased by the existence of an oral hearing and, in many cases, may actually be reduced. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.5 Furthermore, as this appeal demonstrates, if it had not been the decision of the Court to refer matters to the CJEU, it would almost certainly have proved necessary to have an oral hearing to explore some of the issues further or, alternatively, to have engaged in a significant series of rounds of written procedures during which the Court would have addressed questions in writing to the parties. The total amount of judicial resources used would undoubtedly have been all the greater. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.6 I record these observations for the purposes of suggesting that the procedure adopted in this case should be very much the exception and that oral hearings should continue to be the norm in virtually all substantive appeals. In saying that it must, of course, be recognised that the Court has put in place many new measures designed to improve the efficiency of the oral hearing. The fact that an oral hearing may ultimately reduce the amount of judicial resources required to be applied to an appeal is, in my view, clear at least so far as the conduct of litigation in our system is concerned. But that does not mean that oral hearings should take any longer than necessary. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. Mr. Klohn’s Case</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">4.1 In the context of those comments two aspects of the written case made by Mr. Klohn do need some comment. The first concerns a highlighted portion of his written submissions which is to be found towards the very beginning. As part of his proposal that there should not be an oral hearing he suggests that litigants in person hardly ever (if ever) win against professional lawyers and seeks to put that down, at least in part, to the oral hea
