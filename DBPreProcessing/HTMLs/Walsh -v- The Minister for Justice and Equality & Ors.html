             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Mahon delivered on the 23rd day of March 2017</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This is an appeal from part of a judgment of the High Court (Humphreys J.) delivered on 13th June 2016, and the consequential order directing the release of the respondent from prison pursuant to Art. 40.4 of the Constitution. The respondent opposes the appeal and has made oral submissions to this court in support of that opposition.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The background to these proceedings can be briefly stated as follows. On the 31st May 2016 at Waterford Circuit Court, repossession proceedings came on for hearing before the presiding judge (Her Honour Judge Alice Doyle). The plaintiff in the proceedings was Bank of Ireland Mortgages and the defendant was Ms. Feana Walsh, a sister of the respondent. Ms. Walsh was not legally represented and did not personally appear in court. The respondent purported to appear on his sister&#x2019;s behalf and sought the court&#x2019;s leave to address it in that capacity. Leave was firmly refused by the learned circuit judge and there followed an increasingly heated exchange between her and Mr. Walsh in open court and which resulted in the respondent being found in contempt of court for which he was sentenced to two weeks imprisonment. This exchange was precipitated by the learned circuit judge&#x2019;s refusal to permit the respondent to address the court on his sister&#x2019;s behalf, a decision which the learned High Court judge deemed to be </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">correct</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. A full transcript of the proceedings in Waterford Circuit Court has been provided to this court, and I have also had the benefit of listening to the Digital Audio Recording (DAR) of the proceedings. The DAR was also made available to the learned High Court judge, but he declined to listen to it when invited to do so.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. At the outset, it is important to state that while the transcript of the Circuit Court proceedings and the DAR clearly reflect the fact that other individuals frequently interrupted and indeed disrupted the court, the respondent has emphasised that he was in court on that day solely on his sister&#x2019;s behalf, and was not in any way linked to, or associated with, others engaged in that disruptive behaviour. I accept the respondent&#x2019;s assurances in this respect, and I also accept that his motivation for the stance taken by him on the day was entirely related to, as he considered it, the protection of his sister&#x2019;s interests. There were other repossession cases listed on the day and there was, by all accounts, a group of people in court protesting on behalf of other defendants in such cases, and intent on disrupting the work of the court. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The respondent persistently refused to accept the learned Circuit Court judge&#x2019;s ruling denying him a right of advocacy on behalf of his sister citing, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the Power of Attorney Act 1996. The respondent rejected the ruling that he was not entitled to address the court or otherwise maintained that it was acting without jurisdiction on approximately thirteen occasions before being threatened with a finding of contempt. The respondent continued to vociferously object to the court&#x2019;s jurisdiction before again being warned that he would be found in contempt of court. The second warning fell on deaf ears and the learned Circuit Court judge then formally found the respondent to be in contempt of court, to which he replied &#x201c;That is fine&#x201d;. The respondent was ordered to be arrested and removed from the court. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. Later in the day the Walsh repossession proceedings were resumed. There followed a period in which the learned Circuit Court judge was continually interrupted and shouted down by unknown persons in what might reasonably be described as an atmosphere of near anarchy. This is very vividly illustrated by listening to the DAR. This very heated atmosphere must have been extremely difficult, unpleasant, disruptive and indeed intimidating for the judge, court staff and members of the public not engaged in such behaviour. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. By way of illustration of the objectionable nature of the behaviour of some individuals in the court, when one of the interrupters was asked by the learned Circuit Court judge for his name, he replied </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;I have many names&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;my son calls me father and me mother calls me son, what name exactly do you want?&#x201d;</font></i> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. Following a period of relative calm in which the Walsh repossession proceedings were concluded, the respondent, and a Mr. Kavanagh, who had also been arrested and removed from court for disruptive behaviour, were brought back into court. The respondent was offered a solicitor under the Legal Aid Scheme but he declined this offer. He was informed that he was </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;in criminal contempt&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> because he had continued to disrupt the court&#x2019;s business. He also declined the opportunity to apologise to the court and he refused to accept that he had done anything wrong. The learned Circuit Court judge carefully explained to the respondent that he had continued to interrupt the court and had insisted on speaking despite having been ordered to desist from doing so. The respondent was then sentenced to two weeks imprisonment. On occasions during this final exchange between the learned Circuit Court judge and the respondent, other unidentified individuals can be heard raising their voices in clear defiance of the court. The other individual, Mr. Kavanagh, when addressed by the learned Circuit Court judge apologised to the court and was declared free to leave. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. The learned High Court judge, in the course of his judgment, considered the circumstances in which the respondent had been sentenced under the heading &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Was the detention proportionate?&#x201d;.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> He stated, at para. 22:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;22. It is clear that disruption of court proceedings does constitute contempt in the face of the court, which in principle can be dealt with there and then by the judge concerned: see Morris v. Crown Office [1970] All E.R. 1079; Law Reform Commission, Consultation Paper on Contempt of Court (July, 1991) pp. 6 and 24; and In re Rea 2 L.R. Ir. 429 (Q.B. Div. 1878) (a case of a solicitor who was committed for contempt, having &#x201c;shouted at the court in a most violent and unseemly manner&#x201d; (at p. 430)).&#x201d;</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The learned High Court judge went on to say as follows:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;23. However disruption of court proceedings comes in many forms. The applicants in the Morris case were engaged in a calculated and coordinated campaign of disruption. The applicant in the present case rather appears to be someone who came to court under a fundamental misapprehension as to whether he had a legal entitlement to address the court, and had a consequent difficulty in accepting the court&#x2019;s correct ruling in that regard.</font></i> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">24. As distinct, say, from a person who uses language which is an affront to the administration of justice, who engages in disruption by way of protest or physical aggression in a court room, or who by words or gestures threatens any person within or in the precincts of the court, the sort of behaviour for which the present applicant stands condemned, namely speaking out of turn, constitutes what could be regarded as common or garden contempt.</font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">25. In such a case, it is not always necessary for a judge faced with such a contemnor to go the formal route of a finding of contempt followed by arrest, detention and sentence. In many instances it will be sufficient, and therefore more proportionate, simply to direct a person to leave the courtroom, or if he or she fails to do so, to direct the relevant Superintendent and members of the Garda Síochána to compel the contemnor to leave, using reasonable force if necessary.</font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">26. It is not necessary to arrest an individual in order to require him or her to leave a courtroom, or indeed any premises&#x2026; Had Mr. Walsh been simply escorted from the courtroom, he would have been entirely at liberty to go anywhere he
