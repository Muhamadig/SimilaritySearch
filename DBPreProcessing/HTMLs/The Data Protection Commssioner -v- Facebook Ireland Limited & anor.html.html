             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Ms. Justice Costello delivered on the 20th day of February, 2017</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. On the 19th of July, 2016, McGovern J. joined four parties to the proceedings as a</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">mici curiae</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. On the 25th of July, 2016, he directed that the issue as to whether the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amici curiae </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">will be entitled to rely on affidavits they deliver is to be decided by the court. This is my ruling on the application by three of the four </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amici curiae </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">for leave to deliver three affidavits. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. It is clear from the order and judgment of McGovern J. that he envisaged that the amici could assist the trial court whether or not they were permitted to file affidavits. It is also clear that he was of the view that the court had discretion whether or not to permit the amici to file affidavits. At paras. 15 and 16 of his judgment admitting four </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amici curiae</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but refusing the application of six applicants delivered on the 19th of July, 2016, [2016] IEHC 414 he stated:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“These proceedings do involve issues of public law. But they are not, in any real sense, a lis inter partes. One of the reliefs sought by the plaintiff is a reference to the CJEU. It is accepted by all the applicants that, if a reference is made, they cannot be heard before the CJEU unless they were involved in some way before the court of first instance. (See: Article 96 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice of the European Union.)</font></i> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Because there is no factual dispute or lis inter partes in these proceedings, the applicants argue that the usual rule, excluding the involvement of an amicus curiae at the first instance hearing, does not apply. Furthermore, when the issues raised in the proceedings are almost certain to involve a reference to the CJEU, it is essential that any party who has a right to be heard as an amicus curiae should be heard in the proceedings before the High Court. It seems to me that this is a reasonable view.”</font></i></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. It seems clear therefore that he permitted the four </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amici curiae</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> to be joined in order that they not be excluded from a hearing before the Court of Justice of the European Union if the High Court makes a reference, as requested by the plaintiff. Secondly, he accepted the arguments advanced by the applicants that there was no factual dispute or </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">lis inter partes</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the proceedings such as would lead to the exclusion of an amicus curiae at the first instance hearing. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. There was nothing in his judgment to suggest that in order to fulfil their role of assisting the High Court in its determinations that the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amici curiae</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> needed to adduce evidence. In relation to the BSA (the Business Software Alliance), he stated that they should be in a position to offer views which might not otherwise be available to the court. In relation to Digital Europe, he held it would be in a position to assist the court by bringing to bear its expertise in a way which might not otherwise be available to the court. In relation to EPIC (Electronic Privacy Information Centre), he said it would be in a position to offer a counterbalancing perspective from the US government on the position in the US and could bring an expertise which might not otherwise be available to the court. The language he used clearly reflected the language used in the prior authorities including </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fitzpatrick v. FK </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2007] 2 I.R. 406. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. He declined to join the other six applicants as </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amici curiae </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">on the grounds that they could not offer any particular assistance to the court which will not be furnished by the parties to the proceedings, or bring a new perspective beyond that of the parties and the amici he admitted. In refusing to admit Mr. Kevin Cahill as an </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amicus curiae</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, McGovern J. stated that as a general rule an amicu</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">s curiae </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">is not permitted to give evidence. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. He concluded his judgment by putting the matter back for further directions to discuss inter alia the nature of the assistance to be given by the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amici curiae </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">and in particular whether or not such a party wishes to give evidence on US law “…</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as opposed to the US regime surrounding data transfer…” </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">and whether evidence of law should be given by way of affidavit or in submissions.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. It is thus clear that he accepted, as do I, that there is no absolute rule that an amicus curiae can never give evidence but as a general rule an amicus curiae is not permitted to give evidence. This reflects the decision of the Supreme Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H.I. v. Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2003] 3 I.R. 197 in which Keane C.J. accepted that an </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amici curiae </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was not normally entitled to adduce any evidence. The Chief Justice made this observation in the context of holding that the jurisdiction to join an </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amicus curiae </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">is to be exercised “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">sparingly</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">”. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fitzpatrick v. F.K.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Clarke J. in the High Court considered the question of joining an applicant as an </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amicus curiae</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. He held that an important factor to be taken into account was whether the party might reasonably be said to be in a position to bring to bear expertise in respect of an area which might not otherwise be available to the court. But he also accepted that an </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amicus curiae</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">will</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> more readily be joined at the stage of a final court. He emphasised the importance of the involvement of the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amicus</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the legal debate. In para. 31 of the report he stated:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“It is obvious, therefore, that an amicus should not be permitted to involve itself in the specific facts of an individual case. It is only after those facts have been determined that the extent to which issues of general importance may remain for decision will be clear. That is far more likely to be the case at the appellate rather than at the trial level…..While I am not persuaded that there is an absolute bar to parties being joined as amicus curiae at trial level, I believe that the circumstances in which it would be appropriate so to do should, ordinarily, be confined to cases where there is no significant likelihood that the facts of an individual case are likely to be controversial or to have a significant effect on determining what issues of general importance required to be determined.”</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">9. Clarke J. does not envisage </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amici curiae</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> having any role in adducing evidence at the trial. It would be very much the exception for a court to permit an </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amicus curiae </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">adduce evidence at a trial.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. It is absolutely clear that an </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amicus curiae</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> cannot contest the undisputed facts in the case (see </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">EMI Records (Ireland) Ltd and Ors v UPC Communications (Ireland) Ltd </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2013] IEHC 204 para. 69).</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. The role of an </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">amici curiae</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is to assist the court. Therefore, the question the court must ask is: Will the evidence sought to be adduced assist the court in its determination?</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. In this case the plaintiff seeks declarations in relation to the standard contractual clauses (SCCs) insofar as they apply to data transfers from EEA to the United States and a preliminary reference to the CJEU for ruling on the validity of the SCCs insofar as they apply to data transfers from EEA to the United States. Mr. Schrems’ complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner relates to data transfers by Facebook Ireland Ltd to Facebook Inc. in the United States. It follows that the issues for determination by this court relate to transfers of data to the United States; not to any other third country outside the EEA.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. Mr. Higgins on behalf of Digital Europe has sworn an affidavit which is concerned with transfers of data to third countries, including the United States, pursuant to SCCs. The only third country with which this case is concerned is the United States. Facebook Ireland Ltd has adduced evidence in relation to transfers to the United States.
