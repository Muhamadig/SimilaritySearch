             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Tony O’Connor delivered on the 1st day of March, 2017</font></b> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Introduction</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This judgment arises from an application to amend a Statement of Claim delivered on 10th November, 2015 after the cross-examination of a principal witness called by counsel for the plaintiff (Mr. Harry Crosbie [“HC”]) on 30th June, 2016. I have already described the Statement of Claim as “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">precise, concise and what is envisaged by the Rules of the Superior Courts</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">”. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Unfortunately, that conciseness was dissipated by the plaintiff after the cross examination of HC was concluded. The plaintiff at that stage:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) Submitted that there was a “</font>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">contractual matrix</font></i>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">” and referenced discussions which occurred prior to the agreement for lease dated 14th April, 2014 of two kiosks at Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin (“The AFL”) and;</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) Alluded for the first time to a claim for rectification of the AFL to the effect that an area below the kiosks (namely a stairs and a portion of the basement car park) had been agreed to be part of the AFL even though not described in the AFL or outlined on the attachments to the AFL.</font></p>
              </ul> 
              <br> 
             </ul> 
             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Proceedings </font></b>
             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Following the issue of a Notice of Motion on behalf of the plaintiff seeking an interlocutory order restraining the defendant from taking any steps on foot of the defendant’s notice of termination of the AFL, agreement was reached between the parties for the status quo to be maintained pending the determination of the proceedings. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The defendant also sought Security for Costs leading to the plaintiff lodging €100,000.00. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Original Statement of Claim</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The original Statement of Claim challenged the termination notice for the AFL dated 6th July, 2015 on the grounds that a certificate under s. 25 of the Dublin Docks Development Act 1997 (“the 1997 Act”) was in fact a planning permission within the meaning of clause eleven of the AFL requiring the procurement of planning permission by the plaintiff under the AFL within six months. It is not necessary in this judgment to describe other alternative pleas including the plea of “common intention” but suffice to say that the defence delivered on 24th December, 2015 was equally focused on the issues between the parties concerning the entitlement to terminate and the enforceability of the termination notice. Affidavits as to documents were exchanged and the proceedings were allocated 30th June 2016 as a trial date on the application of the plaintiff.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Trial</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. Mr. Simon Crosbie, director of the plaintiff, gave evidence that he and his mother executed the AFL while his father, HC, was the project manager for the two kiosks. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. HC was led through his examination in chief to evidence about plans, communications about the issue of a certificate under the 1997 Act and a notification dated 29th April 2015 of a final decision to grant planning permission by Dublin City Council together with some events leading up to and including July 2015. Counsel for the defendant questioned HC about the map appended to the AFL and put it to him that there was clearly no reference to “the sub-floor basement area underneath either kiosk”. HC responded: “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">There couldn’t possibly be a map for the floor underneath, which would be a completely separate document, which is obviously missing</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">”.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. It is accepted by the plaintiff that “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">unbeknownst to it and by reason of error on its part</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” the demise by the AFL did not include “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the sub-floor basement area underneath</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” (“the excluded areas”). It was clarified in written legal submissions for the hearing of this application on 3rd February, 2017 that the legal team for the plaintiff “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was unaware that the plaintiff had mistakenly believed that the excluded area to be</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” included in the AFL. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. On the second day of trial, counsel for the plaintiff disclosed to this Court that the plaintiff’s architect had retrieved an email dated 30th April, 2014 (a date subsequent to the date of the AFL) which had been sent to the solicitors for the defendant. Counsel for the defendant outlined how the failure to communicate plans and drawings had been specifically pleaded by the defendant. In this regard, the Court notes para. 11 of the defence delivered on 24th December, 2015. This email of 30th April, 2014 could be relevant to issues for consideration. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Counsel for the defendant emphasised how the email, which had not been identified in the Statement of Claim, came after the date of the AFL. Having been afforded time by this Court, the defendant’s solicitors identified the email from their own email retention system without much delay. The Court does not attribute any blame to the legal advisors for the parties who drafted and exchanged pleadings without reference to this email because the neither the plaintiff nor its agents had averted to any such email or attachment prior to the second day of trial. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. I repeat my view expressed last July that the pleadings which had been exchanged, and if relied upon solely, could have allowed for the trial to be completed within a day of the two days allotted for the trial based on the estimate of counsel for the Plaintiff. However, the reliance of counsel for the plaintiff on the “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">contractual matrix</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">”, the introduction of events after the execution of the AFL which had not been pleaded and the new claim for rectification caused the trial’s duration to be extended. Counsel for the plaintiff examined HC for over an hour and a half while counsel for the defendant cross examined HC within an hour. I do not accept the submission that the defendant contributed to under estimating the duration of the trial. The plaintiff remains solely responsible for the information given to the Court when seeking the trial date. Moreover, my decision on 1st July, 2016 to adjourn the balance of the trial to the following term beginning in October 2016 is directly attributable to the unexpected new matters and lengthening of the trial at the then very busy time for the Chancery Division to which the proceedings were assigned.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Having listened to counsel for the parties, I gave liberty on 1st July, 2016 to the plaintiff to deliver a supplemental affidavit as to documents in order to include the email of 30th April, 2014 and to amend its Statement of Claim about the events which the plaintiff wished to rely upon subsequent to the date of the AFL. At that time the claim for rectification was not mentioned specifically. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. A timetable for the completion of matters prior to the resumption of the trial was included in my order made on 1st July, 2016 which provided for the exchange of submissions and the compilation of authorities to be relied upon. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. In accordance with my order, these proceedings were mentioned in this Court on 27th October, 2016 for the purpose of identifying a date to resume the trial of the action. I was then brought through an indexed and leafed booklet of the proposed amended Statement of Claim with a copy of the communications between the solicitors for the parties in relation to their concerns and responses. Counsel for the defendant submitted that the then proposed amended Statement of Claim went beyond the scope of what I had envisaged and I repeat my acceptance of that submission. Counsel for the plaintiff agreed that a specific motion to amend the Statement of Claim should be heard and determined. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. Therefore, the Court on 3rd February, 2017 had a full day of hearing the plaintiff’s application for the extensive amendment of its Statement of Claim. During the course of that hearing the extensive amendments were narrowed down and confined to the following additional paragraphs:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“7. Prior to the conclusion of the AFL the plaintiff’s development plans for the kiosks (“the plans”) had been fully discussed by the plaintiff with the defendants, their servants and agents, including Mr. Michael May, a director of the defendant and Mr. Ray Peers, a director of Q-Park, the company responsible for the day to day management of the grand canal park, both of whom had been authorised and \ or were held out by the defendant its servants and agents as having been authorised to negotiate with the plaintiff on the defendant’s behalf. The defendant’s solicitor, Mr. Michael Neary of Eversheds, who is similarly authorised and \ or held out, was also at the date of conclusion of the AFL fully cognisant of the plans (which were subsequently forwarded to him by email from the plaintiff’s architect on 13th April, 2014 but of which he was cognisant previously) and had the location and nature of the proposed development described to him on site by the plaintiff, its servant and agent. </font></i> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. In particular, and without prejudice to the foregoing, at the date of the AFL and as part of the factual matrix against which same must be construed, it was a fact that all parties to the AFL, their servants and agents were fully cognisant not only of the nature and contents of the Plans but also of the fact that the works proposed by same extended beyond the footprint of the Demised Premises as defined in the AFL and \ or included works to the basement car park and reconfiguration car parking spaces therein and \ or had the continuing common intention that the works should be so carried out in accordance with the Plans. </font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The first planning permission constituted a planning permission within the meaning of clause eleven of the AFL as interpreted against the factual matrix set out in paragraphs seven and eight herein. </font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. Furthermore and without prejudice to the foregoing, if, which is denied, the certificate did not constitute a planning permission within the meaning of the AFL, the AFL did not reflect the continuing common intention of the parties at the date thereof as set out in the same paragraphs with the consequence that the plaintiff is entitled to an order rectifying the AFL to provide that a certificate for works in accordance with the Plans albeit extending beyond the footprint of the Demised Premises and \ or into the basement car park shall constitute planning permission for the purposes of clause eleven of the AFL.”</font></i></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">16. The revised amended Statement of Claim also included the following additional prayer:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“If necessary, an order rectifying the AFL to provide that planning permission, for the purposes of clause eleven, includes permission for a development in accordance with the Plans.”</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">17. The particulars of loss repeated the claim for “Henry A. Crosbie consultancy fee” of “€45,600” despite Mr. Simon Crosbie and HC having given evidence already that there were no invoices for same and that it would only be payable “</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">on completion of the kiosks</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">”.</font>
             <br> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Law</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">18. Order 28(1) of the Rules of the Superior Courts (“RSC”) permits the Court “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">at any stage of the proceedings</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” to grant leave for the amendment of pleadings “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">in such manner and on such terms as may be just</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” while the amendment shall be as “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">necessary for the purpose of determining the questions in controversy between the parties</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">”. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. The Supreme Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Croke v. Waterford Crystal Limited</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2005] 2 I.R. 383 stated at para 36 that this “is intended to be a liberal rule” subject to taking into account other factors. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. O’Sullivan J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cornhill v. Minister for Agriculture</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1998] IEHC 47 stated at para. 21 that:- </font> </p>

               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“An amendment to the pleadings should be allowed if it would have been appropriate in the original pleadings, would have withstood an attack under Order 19(28) of the RSC and provided no injustice (in the sense contemplated by the authorities) is thereby done to the opposing party.”</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">21. Kelly J. in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cuttle v. ACC Bank</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2012] IEHC 105 at para. 8 stressed that it is not for the Court in this type of application to adjudicate on the merits of the proposed amendment or to speculate on the likelihood of its success at trial.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22. I also acknowledge O’Sullivan J.’s view in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cornhill</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at para 19 that the Court does not in this type of application seek to punish for mistakes made in the conduct of cases. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Defendant’s Submissions</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">23. It was submitted for the defendant that the injustice contemplated by the authorities requires the Court to consider the following:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) The plaintiff has had the benefit of pre-trial written submissions and the evidence of the principal witness who was cross-examined on the basis of the original Statement of Claim. This rather unusual mid-trial application for amendment is more than technical in nature and is a substantive amendment (albeit refined at the hearing at this application) which is inconsistent with the original claim. </font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) No evidential basis has been advanced on affidavit to explain the inconsistent grounds for the alternative pleas or the significant delay in notifying the defendant and the Court of the exact amendments sought;</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) The claim for rectification to include the “excluded areas” in the plans which allegedly informed the AFL has no basis because of the evidence already given by HC which indicated that he had understood that there was a map different to the map attached to the AFL.</font></p>
              </ul> 
              <br> 
             </ul> 
             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Determination</font></b>
             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">24. However regrettable the inconvenience and prolonging of these proceedings by the plaintiff’s late application to amend its Statement of Claim, the Court finds that those issues of prejudice can be dealt with by terms which may be imposed in any order of the Court granting leave provided those terms are fulfilled. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">25. I am indeed attentive to the argument that the plaintiff will be putting forward pleas in the alternative in the revised amended Statement of Claim which may appear inconsistent with its original position. However, it is too early to make a determination about the effect of such inconsistencies. In those circumstances, I am not persuaded that the proposed amendment should be struck out in limine as might arise in an analogous application under O.19 (28) of the RSC. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">26. Nevertheless, I take the point that HC has been cross-examined. Subject to hearing a compelling argument for allowing HC to give further evidence, I will include a ruling in the order to be perfected that HC should not now be allowed to revisit his evidence which was tested by the cross-examination undertaken by counsel for the defendant. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27. The absence of an explanation by the plaintiff for the delay in adopting a different and potentially inconsistent position during the trial can go to the weight of the evidence, some of which remains to be adduced. </font> </p>
