             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Brian J. McGovern delivered on the 27th day of January, 2017.</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. In these proceedings, the plaintiffs seek an injunction and other relief arising from an alleged infringement of the plaintiffs&#x2019; copyright and/or design rights in a medical waste disposal system which is the subject of a European Community Trademark no. 011597011 &#x201c;STERIMED&#x201d; by the defendants. The plaintiffs also seek various forms of consequential relief including the taking of all accounts and inquiries including an account of the defendants&#x2019; profits and for damages including aggravated and/or exemplary damages. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The defendants have brought a motion to stay the proceedings in favour of arbitration. The application is brought pursuant to O 56, r 4(1) of the Rules of the Superior Courts, as amended, Article 8(1) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, the Arbitration Act 2010 and/or under the inherent jurisdiction of the court. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The first named plaintiff and the first named defendant are companies registered in Ireland. It is common case that there are a number of agreements which affect the relationship of the parties to the proceedings and some of them include others who are not parties to the proceedings. There is no dispute that two of the agreements contained arbitration clauses. A manufacturing service and supply agreement (the &#x201c;MSS agreement&#x201d;) was entered into on 30th September, 2013, between the first named plaintiff and the first named defendant. Clause 19.4 of the agreement provided for the arbitration of disputes arising out of the contract. The arbitrator was to be agreed by the parties or, in default, was to be appointed by the President of the Law Society of Ireland. That agreement was subject to Irish law. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The other agreement which contained an arbitration clause is the authorised reseller agreement of 1st September, 2014, (&#x201c;the reseller agreement&#x201d;). The first named defendant was not a party to this agreement which was entered into between Innovative Healthcare Distribution LLC (&#x201c;IHD&#x201d;) and the first named plaintiff. Clause 11(h) of the agreement provided for arbitration in Charlotte, North Carolina, in accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. On 8th September, 2014, a further agreement was concluded; namely, a rider to the reseller agreement (&#x201c;the rider agreement&#x201d;). The parties to this agreement were IHD, the first named plaintiff and the first named defendant. The rider agreement incorporated all the terms of the reseller agreement. It also contained a &#x201c;complete agreement clause&#x201d; referred to later in para 9 of this judgment. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. There was a further authorised reseller agreement dated 30th September, 2014, between IHD and the first named plaintiff. The first named defendant is not a party to that agreement and it does not appear to contain an arbitration clause. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The MSS agreement was terminated by an agreement in writing called a termination settlement and release agreement dated 30th June, 2015, (the &#x201c;termination agreement&#x201d;). The parties to the agreement were the first named plaintiff and the first named defendant. Clause 1.1 of the agreement states:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The MSSA is hereby terminated and shall be of no further force or effect from and after the date hereof, except for the undertakings which will remain in full force and effect as specified in s 10 (continuing obligations) of the LOU.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">8. The &#x201c;LOU&#x201d; refers to the letter of understanding dated 15th May, 2015, and evidences an arrangement between the first named plaintiff and first named defendant whereby the provisions in the MSS agreement dealing with intellectual property and confidentiality would survive any termination of the MSS agreement. Clause 10 of the LOU provided for continuing obligations and says:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Section 11 (intellectual property) and s 16 (confidentiality) of the [MSS] agreement would survive the termination.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">9. The reseller agreement of 30th September, 2014, post dates the MSS agreement and the authorised reseller agreement and rider to the reseller agreement. Clause 9(f) of the agreement (the complete agreement clause) of 30th September, 2014, is in the following terms:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Complete Agreement</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This Agreement, together with the Exhibits hereto, contains the entire Agreement between the Parties and supersedes any prior Agreement or understanding concerning the subject matter herein between the Parties, including any and all return policy terms and conditions that may be presented to Buyer.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE TERMS OF ANY PURCHASE ORDER, ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, INVOICE, OR OTHER DOCUMENT ISSUED BUYER OR MANUFACTURER SHALL NOT SUPERSEDE OR SUPPLEMENT THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS SPECIFICALLY STATED TO DO SO WITH REFERENCE TO THIS AGREEMENT, UNLESS SIGNED BY BOTH PARTIES.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Mr Richard Admani (of IHD), Mr Dwight Morgan (formerly of SteriMed Ireland) and Mr Seamus Kilgannon (of Schivo Precision Limited) have deposed to the fact that the reseller and continuous supply agreements, although dated 1st and 8th September, respectively were actually signed on 9th March and 10th March, 2015, respectively. The defendants claim that this was done in the context of a desire between the parties to continue doing business together and allowing the defendants to manufacture the plaintiffs&#x2019; product under license. This is disputed by the plaintiffs. The significance of this is that, if the reseller agreement post dated an earlier reseller agreement of 30th September, 2014, it was not affected by the complete agreement clause and would leave in place the arbitration clause providing for arbitration in Charlotte, North Carolina. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. The plaintiffs maintain that 1st September reseller agreement including its rider agreement is a sham and a nullity and not only is the first named plaintiff not a party to the commercial elements of the purported agreement but it is for no purpose a party to it on account of the known absence of authority of Mr Morgan as agent. The plaintiffs allege that Mr Morgan was in breach of his fiduciary duty to the company and had fraudulently entered into that agreement on behalf of the first named plaintiff at a time when he was trying to set up a rival venture to the detriment of the plaintiffs.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. The onus is on the defendants to establish the existence of the arbitration agreement. If it discharges that burden then the onus shifts the plaintiffs to show that the arbitration agreement was null and void if the court proceedings are not to be stayed. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. The fact that this was the real issue before the court in this application is of some relevance in deciding the proper basis on which the court should determine the application. There are contrasting High Court judgments on the level of judicial scrutiny required. One line of authority applies a </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> judicial review which involves the court referring the matter to arbitration where a party established a </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> case for the existence of an arbitration agreement. The other line of authority involves a full judicial review where the court makes a final determination on the existence of an arbitration agreement. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. The </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> test was applied by Mac Eochaidh J in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">P Elliot &amp; Co Ltd (In Receivership and In Liquidation) v FCC Elliot Construction Ltd</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2012] IEHC 361, which adopted the judgment of Hinkson J in the Canadian Court of Appeal in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Gulf Canada Resources Ltd v Arochen International Ltd </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[1992] BCJ 500, where the learned judge said:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The test formulated is that a stay of proceedings should be ordered where: (i) it is arguable that the subject dispute falls within the terms of the arbitration agreement; and (ii) where it is arguable that a party to the legal proceedings is a party to the arbitration agreement.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">15. In the course of submissions it was brought to my attention that in </font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] IEHC 673, I had noted Mac Eochaidh J&#x2019;s approval of Hinkson J&#x2019;s statement and expressly accepted that interpretation; however, in my decision in </font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">, I expressed the view that there was no evidence to suggest that the agreement was either null or void or inoperative or incapable of being performed.

I accept that, in my decision in </font>
