             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Ms. Justice O’Regan delivered on the 30th day of January, 2017</font></b> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Issues</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Leave was afforded to the applicant on the 27th June, 2016 for judicial review of the decision of the first named respondent bearing the date 6th April, 2016 furnished to the applicant under cover letter dated the 14th April, 2016 which was ultimately received by the applicant on 18th April, 2016, on the basis of an asserted lack of reason contained in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal decision insofar as credibility was concerned and excluding medical evidence on the basis of evidence relative to the issue of credibility. In addition leave was afforded to the applicant to apply for certiorari on the basis that the Tribunal erred in law in failing to consider whether the applicant maybe exposed to persecution on his return to Pakistan by reason of his religion.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Ultimately at the hearing of this matter on the 19th January, 2017 it was indicated to the applicant that insofar as the first ground was concerned having read the submissions and the papers submitted that there was no real basis to condemn the first named respondent’s decision. Following this exchange the applicant’s representatives conferred and decided that the matter could proceed simply on the basis of the second ground advanced namely the Tribunal erred in law in failing to consider whether the applicant maybe exposed to persecution on his return to Pakistan by reason of his religion.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Brief background</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The applicant is a Pakistani and was born in 1987. He arrived in Ireland on the 14th October, 2013 and applied for asylum on the 17th October, 2013. He had two s. 11 interviews namely on the 10th December, 2013 and the second one on the 13th May, 2014. A s. 13 report issued on the 18th June, 2014 and on the 9th July, 2014 the applicant was advised that his application for refugee status was refused and as a consequence he served a notice of appeal dated the 23rd July, 2014. By way of decision on the 6th April, 2016 the first named respondent issued a decision denying the applicant refugee status. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The impugned decision</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The decision identifies that there was a hearing in respect of the appeal on the 25th November 2015. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> It appears to me that para. 2.1 is relevant and provides: -</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">“The appellant is a 28 year old man who has received education to third level. He is Shia Muslin and claims that he is at risk from extremist groups because of his race religion and political opinion.”</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The decision then goes on to deal with the two asserted incidents in Pakistan as to why the applicant allegedly flew from Pakistan. In respect of the personal assault on the applicant he has given different dates as to when this occurred namely in June 2012 and June 2013. The Tribunal was dissatisfied with the explanation for the different dates. The second incident which the applicant has relied on is an alleged killing of certain members of his family on the 8th September, 2013. Ultimately the Tribunal did not accept the applicant’s evidence in this regard for various reasons. A further problem identified by the Tribunal was as to the identity of the party who organised for the plaintiff’s travel to Ireland. In this regard the applicant initially asserted that his brother had organised travel for him however later asserted that it was his mother as his brother wouldn’t speak to him because the brother felt that the applicant had deserted his family in Pakistan.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. At para. 3.12 it is provided:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">“On the basis of the documentation received from the U.K. authorities, and the finger print of the applicant, the Tribunal is satisfied that the appellant is a Pakistani national. The Tribunal proceeded to determine the appellant’s claim on the basis that he is a Pakistani.”</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">7. At para. 4.5 The Tribunal identifies that the applicant’s core claim is that as a result of his religion (Shia Muslim) he is fearful of persecution in Pakistan.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. The decision of the Tribunal runs to fourteen pages and there is no further mention of the applicant’s religion within the decision save that there is reference to religion in the country of origin information which was considered. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. At para. 4.26 it was indicated that all matters were considered in the round and the Tribunal found that the appellant was deliberately unhelpful and uncooperative.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. At para. 5.1 it is provided as follows:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"> </font>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">“The appellant has not established to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that he has any forward looking well founded fear or persecution in Pakistan”.</font>
              </ul> 
              <br> 
             </ul> 
             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Submissions</font></b>
             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">11. The applicants submissions are to the effect that the analysis as to well founded fear is not in fact an analysis at all or if it could be described as analysis it is wholly insufficient and/or inadequate and/or unreasonable. The applicant relies upon the judgment of Cooke J. in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.A.M.A. v. Refugee Appeals Tribunal &amp; Ors</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2011] IEHC 147 the judgment delivered on the 8th April, 2011. In this regard para. 17 of the judgment contains the relevant jurisprudence that is relied on and reads as follows:</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> “This court accepts as correct the approach to the standard of proof outlined in this case law. The sole fact that particular facts or events relied upon as evidence of past persecution have been disbelieved will not necessarily relieve the administrative decision maker of the obligation to consider whether, nevertheless, there is a risk of future persecution of the type alleged in the event of repatriation. In practical terms, however, the precise impact of the finding of lack of credibility in that regard upon the evaluation of the risk of future persecution must necessarily depend upon the nature and extent of the findings which reject the credibility of the first stage. This is because the obligation to consider the risk of future persecution must have a basis in some elements of the applicant’s story which can be accepted as possibly being true. The obligation to consider the need for “reasonable speculation” is not an invitation or pretext for gratuitous speculation: it must have some basis in, and connection to, the apparent circumstances of the applicant.”</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. The respondent counters that using the term “will not necessarily relieve” implies that in some cases the fact of past events not being believed will relieve the administrative decision maker of the obligation to consider a risk of future persecution. I accept this submission.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. The applicant also relied on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">MMA v. Refugee Appeals Tribunal &amp; Ors</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. (Unreported, High Court, MacEochaidh J., 13th February, 2013). At para. 26 MacEochaidh J. states as follows:</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> “In passing, I note that the case law, and in particular, the decision of Cooke J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.A.M.A. v. the Refugee Appeals Tribunal</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2001] IEHC 147, clearly sets out the law on when an international protection decision maker must decide whether there is a risk of persecution in a forward looking way based upon an accepted nationality or ethnicity. When does that core element have to be decided? The M.A.MA. case examines the point at which a Tribunal Member or a decision maker can find that the underlying facts supporting the claim for persecution are so lacking in credibility that there is no reason to proceed to determine ethnicity or the question of applying the forward looking test as to a fear of persecution.</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">I have no doubt that if the credibility were fair findings this is a case which would have fallen squarely within the category of cases where the decision maker should have asked the question: ‘What if I am wrong about credibility - should I decide the rest of the issues in the case?’”</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">14. Clearly MacEochaidh J. also accepts that in some circumstances the lack of credibility on the part of the applicant relieves the decision maker for looking at the possibility of persecution if repatriated. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The respondents rely upon the decision delivered by Humphreys J. on the 4th November, 2015 in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">A(R) v. Refugee Appeals Tribunal &amp; Ors</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. [2015] IEHC 686 notwithstanding that the applicant takes exception to reference to this case given the fact the case is under appeal and due shortly for hearing before the Court of Appeal. </font> </p>
