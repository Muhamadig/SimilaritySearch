             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Mahon delivered on the 29th day of March 2017</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The respondents issued High Court proceedings by way of special summons on the 1st September 2007 seeking possession of Kileek, St. Margarets, Swords, Co. Dublin (being the property comprised in Folio DN142452F Co. Dublin) on foot of a mortgage contract entered into on the 8th December 2006 relating to a loan of €245,000 advanced by the respondent to the appellant and Mrs. Tierney. Repayments servicing the said loan fell into arrears with the consequence that as of the end of November 2014 arrears stood at €161,958. 61, with a total outstanding balance of €349, 587.75. Possession of the property was granted to the respondents by order of the High Court (Dunne J.) on the 13th October 2008 (with a stay on execution for a period of four months). The said order records as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“Whereupon and upon reading the documents specified in the schedule hereto and upon hearing said counsel and there being no attendance by or on behalf of the second defendant.</font></i> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">By consent it is ordered that the defendants do forthwith upon service of this order upon them deliver up to the plaintiff or to some person duly authorised by it in writing in that behalf possession of … Kileek, St. Margarets, Swords, Co. Dublin.”</font></i></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">2. On the 25th July 2016 an application was made to the High Court pursuant to Order 12, r. 26 and / or Order 13, r. 11 of the Rules of the Superior Courts on behalf of the appellant, (Mr. Tierney) to set aside the order of possession made on the 30th October 2008. That application was refused by the High Court (McDermott J.). Mr. Tierney has appealed against that order. His wife, Mrs. Tierney (the second defendant), is not a party to these proceedings and the said order of the High Court dated the 13th October 2008 remains in effect as against her. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The focus of Mr. Tierney’s appeal is his contention that he was never served with the proceedings seeking possession of Kileek. He further maintains that he was unaware of the proceedings in the High Court on the 13th October 2008, or the order for possession of the property and remained unaware of same until telephoned by Mrs. Tierney on the 9th February 2016 to inform him that the Sheriff had arrived to execute the possession order. Mr. Tierney’s application to set aside the order for possession is dated the 22nd March 2016, some five weeks later. In his grounding affidavit sworn on the 16th of March 2016, Mr. Tierney maintained that prior to the 9th February 2016 he was unaware of “difficulties” with the mortgage, or of any contact, negotiations or settlements with the respondent. He said that he had relied on his wife to make repayments on behalf of both of them. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. In relation to the order of the High Court of the 13th October 2008, and contrary to what is stated therein, Mr. Tierney maintains that he was not present in the court (nor was he aware of the proceedings). Furthermore, Mr. Tierney contends that, again, contrary to what is stated in the body of the order, he did not consent to an order for possession. Mrs. Tierney maintains that, contrary to what is contained in the body of the order she was, in fact, present in court on the 13th October 2008 but, again, contrary to what is in the order, she did not consent to an order for possession being made. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The service of the proceedings </font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">5. It is common case that the special summons and grounding affidavit were served on Mrs. Tierney alone at 2.20 p.m. on the 10th October 2007 at Kileek, and that she agreed with the summons server that she would accept service on her husband’s behalf as he was not in the house, although she then indicated that he was in the house, but was indisposed. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The service of the summary summons did not, on its face, comply with Order 9, r. 4 which provides as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“When husband and wife are both defendants in any proceedings, they shall both be served unless the Court shall otherwise order.”</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">7. No order for any other mode of service was made, or sought, nor was any application made to deem the service effected on the 10th October 2007 good (in respect of Mr. Tierney). </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. In his affidavit of the 6th March 2009, Mr. Padraic Costello, summons server, averred that he served a copy of the order for possession on Mr. and Mrs. Tierney by handing a true copy of the said order to each at Kileek on the 20th February 2009, and that he also served them with a demand for possession of the said property. Mr. Tierney maintains that he was not so served, while Mrs. Tierney accepts that she was served with the documentation but did not, in turn, provide it to Mr. Tierney. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. While Order 9, r. 4 provides specifically that the service of a summons in an action where a husband and wife are both defendants be effected on them both, a failure to serve in this manner is not necessarily fatal to the proceedings. In this case the summons server took what, to many, would appear to have been a practical and common sense approach to effect service by serving Mrs. Tierney with the document on her explicit agreement to pass on the relevant documentation to her husband. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Failure to serve the summons in the manner proscribed by Order 9, r. 4 is capable of correction. An application could have been made for substituted service on Mr. Tierney or for an order deeming service on him through the intermediary of Mrs. Tierney to be good service. Neither step was taken. A deficiency in service could also have been corrected if Mr. Tierney was present in court in the course of the repossession proceedings heard by Dunne J. on the 13th of October 2008. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. There was no averment in the affidavit of Siobhan Coen (the respondent’s company secretary), or indeed in any other affidavit sworn on behalf of the respondent, to the effect that Mr. Tierney was seen to have been physically present in court on the day in question. Therefore what is at issue is whether or not the order of the 13th October 2008 erroneously, possibly because of human error in its drafting, states that Mr. Tierney, rather than Mrs. Tierney, was present in court. Errors can and do occur in the drafting of court orders. What is more puzzling is how the order also came to record that the order for possession was being made on consent in circumstances where, apparently, if Mrs. Tierney is to be believed, no such consent was indicated at all. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Order 41, r. 15 of the Rules of the Superior Courts provides:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“In any cause or matter where the defendant has appeared by solicitor, no order for entering judgement shall be made by consent unless the consent of the defendant is given by his solicitor. Where the defendant has not appeared, or has appeared in person, no such order shall be made unless the defendant attends before the Court and gives his consent in person, or unless his written consent is attested by a solicitor acting on his behalf.”</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">13. There is no written judgment or other written note available from the learned High Court judge. What has been made available to the Court, apparently with the agreement of both parties, is a helpful summary of the judgment prepared by Mr. Rowan B.L., counsel for the respondent, and sent to his solicitors in the immediate aftermath of the proceedings in the High Court. It is clear from that memorandum at the learned High Court judge placed considerable importance on the following:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) No issue had ever been taken with the service of the order of Dunne J. on Mr. Tierney. He noted that </font>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“Mrs. Tierney is the spouse of Mr. Tierney and resides at the property since before the order to the present day”</font></i>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) A reasonable effort had been made to ser
