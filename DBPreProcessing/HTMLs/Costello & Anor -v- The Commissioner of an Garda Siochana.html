             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Keane delivered on the 17th February 2017 </font></b> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Introduction</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The plaintiffs move for interlocutory orders directing that this action be tried by judge and jury; that it be transferred into the jury list for that purpose; and that time be extended to permit the application to be made. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The plaintiffs&#x2019; claim</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The plaintiffs delivered their statement of claim on the 13th January 2006. In it, they seek a wide range of reliefs against the defendant. Those reliefs include four separate permanent injunctions restraining any member of An Garda Síochána from: 1) attending at the plaintiffs&#x2019; home; 2) watching or besetting the plaintiffs at their home; 3) driving up to or alighting from a vehicle at or near the plaintiffs&#x2019; home; and 4) watching, besetting or following the first plaintiff wherever he may go. The plaintiffs further seek damages for trespass to the person by harassment, watching and besetting, intimidation and the intentional infliction of emotional suffering; damages for repeated wrongful arrest; and damages for criminal slander.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Procedural history</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. These proceedings commenced as long ago as the 21st December 2005, when a plenary summons issued on behalf of the plaintiffs. On the same date, Laffoy J granted interim injunctions in the same terms as the permanent injunctions already described. On the 29th December 2005, on consent between the parties, Finlay Geoghegan J. granted a narrower interlocutory injunction, pending the trial of the action, restraining members of An Garda Síochána from entering the plaintiffs&#x2019; property except under authority of a warrant or at the request of a member of the household. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. A defence was delivered on the 23rd March 2006. Since then, progress towards the trial of the action has been slow. On the 3rd October 2007, pursuant to the terms of O. 19, r. 27 of the Rules of the Superior Courts 1986, as amended (&#x2018;the RSC&#x2019;), Laffoy J struck out certain parts of the plaintiffs&#x2019; statement of claim that alleged various incidents of watching and besetting, or harassment and intimidation, as tending to prejudice the fair trial of the action, because the incidents concerned had not been dated even by reference to the year in which each was alleged to have occurred. The plaintiffs appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, which dismissed the appeal on the 5th February 2010. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. A reply to defence was delivered on the 26th February 2010. Having joined issue with the defence, it pleads, in response to the defendant&#x2019;s denial of watching and besetting, intimidation or harassment, and further denial that any such cause of action as &#x2018;watching and besetting&#x2019; is known to law, that the relevant plea in the statement of claim &#x2018;amounts to and constitutes a claim for misfeasance of public office.&#x2019;</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. On the 14th October 2014, White J refused the defendant&#x2019;s application for an order dismissing the proceedings on the ground of the plaintiffs&#x2019; inordinate and inexcusable delay in prosecuting them, but awarded the defendant his legal costs of that application and, perhaps more significantly, discharged the interlocutory injunction that Finlay Geoghegan J had granted almost nine years before. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mode of trial</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The plaintiffs&#x2019; then solicitors served four separate notices of trial in 2011. They were dated the 26th February, the 19th March, the 21st June, and the 6th July respectively. Each gave notice of the trial of the action &#x2018;before a Judge and Jury.&#x2019; </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. On the 12th July 2011, just less than a week after the last such notice of trial was served, the defendant issued a motion seeking orders striking it out and directing the transfer of the proceedings into the non-jury list for trial before a judge sitting alone.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. By fax dated the 21st July 2011, the plaintiffs&#x2019; then solicitors notified the defendant&#x2019;s solicitors that the matter had been set down and assigned a number in the non-jury list on the 18th July 2011, and requested confirmation that the defendant&#x2019;s motion to strike out the plaintiffs&#x2019; notice of trial could be struck out on that basis with no order for costs.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. When the defendant&#x2019;s motion came before the Court shortly afterwards it was struck out on consent. On behalf of the defendant, Inspector Jeremiah Keohane of An Garda Síochána has averred that, in opposing the defendant&#x2019;s application for his legal costs of the motion, Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted to the court that it had been the plaintiffs&#x2019; intention at all times to set the matter down before a judge sitting alone but a notice of trial before a judge and jury had issued in error. Murphy J awarded the defendant his costs of that motion.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The present application</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">11. The plaintiff now moves for an Order directing that these proceedings should be tried by a judge and jury, pursuant to O. 36, r. 6 of the RSC, and an Order extending the time for bringing the application for that Order, pursuant to the same rule or, alternatively, O. 122, r.7.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Order, 36, rule 6 of the RSC provides, in substance, that in all cases in which the parties are entitled to a jury trial, the party serving a notice of trial shall state in it whether he requires a jury trial or not, and the case shall be tried in accordance with that election, unless it is for trial by a judge sitting alone and another party to the action then elects for a jury trial in writing within 14 days of the service of the notice or within such further time as the court may allow. Order 122, rule 7 of the RSC provides in material part that, subject to any relevant provision of statute, the Court shall have power to extend or abridge the time permitted for doing any act under the Rules, even where an application to extend time is made outside the time permitted. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. The application is grounded on the affidavit of John Geary, the plaintiffs&#x2019; solicitor, sworn on the 27th November 2015. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. Mr Geary avers, in relevant part, as follows. He took over carriage of the proceedings from the plaintiffs&#x2019; previous solicitors on the 13th October 2013. He wrote to the defendants&#x2019; solicitors on the 12th May 2015, enclosing a copy of the notice of trial dated the 6th July 2011 and stating that he had been informed, on inquiry at the Central Office, that the said notice was still &#x2018;live and current.&#x2019; In that letter, he went on to express the belief that, in consequence, the case must have been incorrectly set down for trial in the Chancery list. The defendant&#x2019;s solicitors wrote back on the 12th May 2015, summarising the position as already described and insisting that there had been no mistake.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The present motion issued on the 30th November 2015. At paragraph 5 of his affidavit, Mr Geary avers:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;I say and believe that having reviewed the files and without wishing to cast any aspersions of fault or blame on any party that the issue has come about as a result of human error on the part of the then solicitors for the plaintiff (sic) and am satisfied that this matter has been wrongly listed in the non-jury list&#x2026;.&#x2019;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Mr Geary does not explain the nature of the error that he believes was made by the plaintiffs&#x2019; former solicitors, nor does he engage with the averments made, and documents exhibited, on behalf of the defendant, which are fundamentally inconsistent with that belief. The plaintiffs&#x2019; position appears to be that, once their solicitor has satisfied himself that an undisclosed and unspecified error was made by their former solicitors, no further evidence &#x2013; indeed, no evidence at all &#x2013; is necessary to satisfy the Court that it is appropriate to grant the relief now sought. Beyond that, it is difficult to know quite what to make of Mr Geary&#x2019;s averment that, in squarely blaming the plaintiffs&#x2019; former solicitors in this unsatisfactory way, he does not wish &#x2018;to cast any aspersions of fault or blame on any party.&#x2019;</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. Order 36, rule 18 of the RSC provides that unless an action is set down for trial within 14 days after a notice of trial is given, the notice shall no longer be in force. Thus, it seems to me that, if the plaintiffs&#x2019; notice of trial of the 6th July 2011 is still in force, it is because the matter was set down for trial in the non-jury list on the plaintiffs&#x2019; behalf on the 18th July 2011. There is no suggestion that there is any other notice of trial extant.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The right to jury trial in civil proceedings</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">18. There is no constitutional right to a jury trial in civil proceedings; </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">D.F. v Garda Commissioner</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] IESC 44 (at §12).

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. Section 48 of the Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877 (&#x2018;the 1877 Act&#x2019;) provides in relevant part that:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2018;&#x2026;nothing in this Act, or in any Rule made under its provisions, shall take away or prejudice the right of any party to any action to have questions of fact tried by a jury in such case as he might heretofore of right have so required&#x2026;.&#x2019;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul>

             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Wylie, The Judicature Acts (Ireland)</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Dublin, 1906) notes (at p. 528) that, in the Common Law Courts, a party had a right to trial by jury in all cases, except in a limited class involving substantially only matters of account, and, in the Court of Chancery, a party had no right to a jury, except in a very few cases.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21. Section 94 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924, substantially replicates s. 48 of the 1877 Act. However, as Hogan J. noted in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lennon v HSE</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, already cited (at §21), through various statutory changes made over the last 150 years, the right to jury trial in civil matters has been gradually whittled away. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22. The statutory encroachment upon that right at the core of the present application is the one effected by s. 1 of the Courts Act 1988 (&#x2018;the 1988 Act&#x2019;). It provides, in material part:</font> </p>

             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Discussion</font></b>
             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">23. At paragraph 12 of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs plead that they have each suffered severe personal injury, emotional trauma, loss, damage, inconvenience and expense in consequence of the tortious conduct they allege. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">24. In describing that tortious conduct, at paragraphs 6 and 8 of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs particularise multiple instances of what they plead amounted to &#x2018;watching and besetting, harassment and intimidation&#x2019; of them on various dates between 1996 and 2005. Several of those allegations, if made out at trial, would amount to false imprisonment or intentional trespass to the person, or both, arising from what the plaintiffs contend was the wrongful detention for the purpose of search of the first plaintiff on a number of occasions and, on at least one occasion, of the second plaintiff. As s. 1(3) of the 1988 Act provides and as the Supreme Court confirmed in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">D.F. v Garda Commissioner</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, already cited, (at § 18), such actions remain within the province of a jury trial.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">25. However, several of the allegations in those two paragraphs of the statement of claim involve conduct comprising quite separate acts that cannot be characterised as involving either the false imprisonment, or trespass to the person, of the plaintiffs. Examples of such alleged acts include: the seizure from another person of a vehicle that belonged to the first plaintiff; the search of the workplace of the first plaintiff&#x2019;s father; an accusation directed by a member of An Garda Síochána to the first plaintiff that he was &#x2018;engaging in tricks&#x2019;; a disparaging remark made by a member of An Garda Síochána to the first plaintiff when the latter attended at a garda station to produce his insurance; an occasion when a member or members of An Garda Síochána followed the plaintiffs&#x2019; children who were walking to a local football match; approximately one hundred and eighty separate occasions on which garda vehicles drove into and out of, or parked in, the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">cul de sac</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> where the plaintiffs&#x2019; home is located; and another occasion on which the plaintiffs&#x2019; son was followed in the vicinity of their home by two members of An Garda Síochána in an unmarked garda car. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">26. While the point was not directly addressed on behalf of the plaintiffs, Counsel for the defendant pointed out that, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#x2019;C. v K.L.H.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2007] 1 I.R. 802 (at 811-812), Dunne J. found that certain matters complained of there as amounting to intimidation, harassment and victimisation could not come within the definition of intentional trespass to the person. In reaching that conclusion, Dunne J. had considered, amongst other authorities, the decision of the House of Lords in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Wainwright v Home Office</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2003] 3 W.L.R. 1137, including a passage from the judgment of Lord Hoffman LJ in which, considering the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Wilkinson v Downton</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1897] 2 Q.B. 57, the leading decision on the intentional infliction of emotional suffering, he concluded (at § 47):</font> </p>

It may be, as Counsel for the defendant suggests, that the relevant aspects of what is complained of in this case as &#x2018;watching and besetting&#x2019; (which do not amount to false imprisonment or trespass to the person) might more properly be characterised as falling within the tort of private nuisance; see McMahon and Binchy, </font>
