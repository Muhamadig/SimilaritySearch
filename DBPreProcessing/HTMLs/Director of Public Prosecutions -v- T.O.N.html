             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Robert Eagar delivered on the 21st day of June, 2016</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The issue which is before this Court is whether or not the accused in this case, T.O.N. is fit to be tried. On 30th July, 2014 Sheehan J. having considered the evidence of Dr. Peter Leonard, Dr. Damien Mohan and social worker Marian Timmons, decided that T.O.N was fit to be tried and directed that the trial should proceed. That court in reaching this conclusion placed great weight on the length of time Dr. Mohan and Marian Timmons had in which to observe and interact with T.O.N, as against the period of time that Dr. Leonard spent with T.O.N in the course of his two assessments. In particular the court preferred the view of Dr. Mohan as to why T.O.N was reluctant to deal with the allegations against him. Having regard to that decision of Sheehan J., this Court will not act as an appellate court. However, this Court is prepared to take note of any issues which may have arisen between the 30th July, 2014 and the hearing of this matter on 7th and 8th June, 2016. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The Court is aware that the accused was born on the 3rd August, 1941, is 75 years old, and resides in Co. Wexford. He is the eldest of five siblings and worked with the local authority in Wexford for 21 years before he retired. He is charged with 73 offences. This Court notes that they are all in respect of alleged sexual offending committed against four sisters living in Wexford between 2001 and 2006, and are thus not particularly old charges. There are 18 charges of rape and 56 charges of sexual assault. The sisters ranged in age from four to ten when the sexual offending is alleged to have commenced. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Section 4 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 provides for fitness to plead issues to be determined by a judge. Section 4 (1):</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;(1) Where in the course of criminal proceedings against an accused person the question arises, at the instance of the defence, the prosecution or the court, as to whether or not the person is fit to be tried the following provisions shall have effect.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) An accused person shall be deemed unfit to be tried if he or she is unable by reason of mental disorder to understand the nature or course of the proceedings so as to&#x2014;</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (a) plead to the charge,</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (b) instruct a legal representative, </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) in the case of an indictable offence which may be tried summarily, elect for a trial by jury, </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d) make a proper defence,</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(e) in the case of a trial by jury, challenge a juror to whom he or she might wish to object, or </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(f) understand the evidence.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Section 4 (4) (b) states:</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;the question of whether the accused person is fit to be tried shall be determined by the judge concerned sitting alone.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">4. It appears to be agreed by counsel that the onus of proof rests on the defence to satisfy the court on the balance of probabilities that the accused is unfit to be tried. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The history of the case has been set out by Mr. Coffey and he indicates that the case came for trial on the 4th March, 2013 before Sheehan J. and on that occasion the issue of fitness to plead was raised by both the prosecution and defence. On the basis of the uncontroversial evidence that was given on that occasion, the court found that the accused was unfit to plead and in consequence he was committed on 15th March, 2013 to the Central Mental Hospital for inpatient treatment. The Act provides for the review of detention by the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board (herein &#x2018;Review Board&#x2019;) and he was reviewed on three occasions by the Board. The first occasion was the 2nd August, 2013 when the Review Board determined to continue his detention. The second occasion was 22nd November, 2013 when it made a similar order. However, when the matter came back before the Review Board on 6th March, 2014 the Review Board determined that the accused was fit to be tried and sent the matter back to the Central Criminal Court. Under the Act, when such an order is made, it is for the relevant court to make such order as it thinks proper. On 10th March, 2014 the accused was admitted to bail pending further order in the matter. The matter substantively came back before Sheehan J. on 28th July, 2014 and it did so for a further fitness hearing, for the purpose of determining whether the Review Board was correct in its conclusion.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. It is commonplace that the accused has no history of mental illness. He has an IQ of 53 which is in the lower range for mild mental retardation, bordering on moderate mental retardation. Both Dr. Leonard, Dr. Mohan and Marian Timmons gave evidence before Sheehan J. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The matter does not come back before this Court because of some adverse development or some newly discovered medical fact, but by way of correspondence from the accused solicitors dated the 20th May, 2016 in which the defence indicated that they wished to withdraw their appeal against the determination of Sheehan J. to the Court of Appeal and wished to re-agitate the issue of fitness on the trial date. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. Dr. Leonard gave evidence that he was a consultant psychiatrist at St. Joseph&#x2019;s Intellectual Disability Service, St. Ita&#x2019;s, Portrane, Co. Dublin, and that he has dual specialist registration with the Medical Council of Ireland in both psychiatry of learning disability and adult psychiatry. He has extensive experience in forensic psychiatry and prior to his current appointment he worked at the Psychiatry Court Liaison Service based at Cloverhill Prison. He works primarily with people who have intellectual disabilities and severe behavioural problems. He gave evidence of the two previous interviews with T.O.N he conducted over a period of three hours on 10th May, 2012 and 11th May, 2014. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. Dr. Leonard stated that T.O.N informed him that he attended his GP in relation to his diabetes. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Dr. Leonard stated that: </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;In comparison to my initial assessment which had been four years ago, and consistent with my second assessment two years ago T.O.N, he presented as evasive and reluctant to engage.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When asked about the alleged indexed offence, he replied, &#x2018;I was supposed to rape the young woman, something I didn&#x2019;t do&#x2019;, and then he replied, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t remember&#x2019; or &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know&#x2019; to all of my enquiries in relation to the alleged indexed offence.&#x201d;</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dr. Leonard then said,</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;He really clammed up in relation to the discussion of the alleged indexed offence.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">Dr. Leonard referred to the book of evidence in which T.O.N&#x2019;s confession to the Gardaí comprised of an admission of having had sexual intercourse on repeated occasions over an extended period with M.S., who was a child with at the material time. The general pattern through the records of the interview was T.O.N initially denying the offences, and subsequently admitting the offences when pressed. There are admissions by T.O.N of the commission of sexual assaults on three other siblings and T.O.N admitted to having paid for sex on a regular basis with Md.S., the mother of the family. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. Dr. Leonard gave evidence that he had T.O.N on 26th May, 2016 in the offices of Coughlan Kelly Solicitors. He described him as unkempt in appearance, more so than on other occasions, that his clothes were soiled and there was a smell of body odour indicating a significant degree of neglect of personal hygiene. He said that T.O.N was alert throughout the interview. When asked about the offences he stated, </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Leading up to the hearing before this Court, Dr. Leonard assessed T.O.N on the 26th May, 2016. Dr. Mohan assessed T.O.N on 30th May, 2016. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. The new matters which Dr. Leonard identified in his report of 26th May, 2016 are as follows:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">i. T.O.N described his cooking habits and said he no longer gets &#x201c;meals on wheels&#x201d;. Instead he cooks for himself each day. The repertoire of meals he can prepare consists of a number of vegetables which are prepared by boiling (potatoes, onions and cabbage, and sometimes bacon which is also boiled). He said that for breakfast he would usually eat Weetabix or Corn Flakes. He sometimes has a sandwich. He said he has a washing machine and is able to use it. He does not have central heating because he has a stove which he says effectively heats the house. </font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ii. In terms of personal hygiene, he said he would have a shower three or four times a week. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">iii.He also reported that he had very limited social supports and having regard to the nature of the charges this is not surprising. T.O.N explained to Dr. Leonard that he has lost all his friends as a consequence of all of the charges he faces. There appears, to this Court, to be a clear awareness by T.O.N as to the reason why he lost his friends. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">iv.Dr. Leonard set out the medication which T.O.N was on, including the medication for non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. In answer to the Court, Dr. Leonard understood that he attended his G.P. in relation to his diabetes. There are no new medical issues and whilst the diet of boiled vegetables and boiled bacon may be monotonous, it is certainly appropriate for a person with diabetes mellitus.</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">14. Dr. Leonard also pointed out that in comparison to his initial interview of 14th June, 2012 and consistent with his second interview on the 17th June, 2014, T.O.N presented as being particularly evasive and reluctant to engage. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. Despite the very strong evidence, including the evidence of admissions by T.O.N and forensic evidence indicating that T.O.N is the likely father of the child of M.S., Dr. Leonard took the view that he lacked the ability to fully grasp the significance of this evidence, and was not capable of using this knowledge in a rational manner in order to weigh up and consider his options in terms of entering a plea. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Dr. Leonard said that T.O.N presented as a man in his mid 70&#x2019;s of small stature, is clearly overweight, has grey, balding hair and was very unkempt in appearance. His clothes were soiled and he wore a fleece jumper with no shirt underneath. He wore shoes with no socks. He had attempted to shave himself but had done so incompletely and as noted in his previous assessments of T.O.N there was a strong smell of body odour indicating a significant degree of neglect of personal hygiene. Dr. Leonard also noted that he was hard of hearing. When Dr. Leonard inquired about discussions T.O.N would have had with his solicitor regarding his case and the type of decisions he would have to make, he said,</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember&#x201d;.</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">Unlike previous assessments, T.O.N did not recognise the process of fingerprinting. He recognised the witness box. He had difficulty explaining what the role of the judge is and, in contrast with previous assessments, T.O.N appeared to have difficulty with the terms &#x201c;giving evidence&#x201d; and being &#x201c;cross examined&#x201d;. However, on perusing the report of Dr. Leonard of 14th June, 2012 very little change in relation to these issues was exhibited in Dr. Leonard&#x2019;s most recent report. In answer to this Court&#x2019;s question as to whether Dr. Leonard has worked with sex offenders, and has dealt with sexual offenders experiencing denial, Dr. Leonard said he did have experience in this area, and opined that denial was a relatively consistent finding in the examination of sexual offenders. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. This Court notes the report of Dr. Mohan, dated 26th July, 2013 where Dr. Mohan commented, </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;T.O.N does appear to be able to recall events and demonstrates an understanding of matters unrelated to the offending behaviour&#x2026; At interview with me, T.O.N comes across as being vague and evasive initially, he would maintain that he was unable to understand my questions. However after the question is repeated he is clearly able to understand the question. He is very avoidant when it comes to discussing his alleged offending behaviour.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">He continues,</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;I have no doubt that T.O.N has a good understanding of the nature of the charges for which he is before the Court. I have no doubt that T.O.N understands the difference between a guilty and a not guilty plea.&#x201d; </font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">This report was compiled a number of months after T.O.N was first admitted to the Central Mental Hospital on 4th March, 2013 and was prepared for the Review Board. He continued,</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;However there is some doubt as to whether or not he would be able to instruct his legal representative and make a proper defence. At the time of writing this report it is my view that T.O.N would experience difficulty in understanding and following the evidence.&#x201d; </font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">He then stated,</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;It is the intention of this clinical team to continue to observe T.O.N and to continue with his psychological assessments in order to assist us in making a determination in whether or not he would have the requisite capacity to understand the evidence relating to this charge.&#x201d;</font>
