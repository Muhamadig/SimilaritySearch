             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice David Keane delivered on the 3rd February 2017 </font></b> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Introduction</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The first respondent seeks an order directing that her costs of the present action be paid out of the estate of her late husband. The applicants oppose the making of any such order. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The action was brought to remove the first respondent as administratrix of her late husband’s estate. In a judgment delivered on the 25th November 2016, the Court granted that relief; see </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Muckian v Hoey</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IEHC 688. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The applicants and the other respondents in the action are the children of the marriage between the first respondent and the deceased. The other respondents did not participate in the proceedings.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The applicants seek an order directing that the costs of their successful action be paid out of the estate. The first respondent does not oppose that application. In truth, it is difficult to see how she could. The only plausible alternative to that order would be one granting the applicants their costs against the first respondent.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first respondent’s arguments</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">5. In seeking her costs of the action out of the estate, the first respondent submits that the successful application to remove her as adminstratrix is one properly characterised as an administration suit. The proceedings were brought by special summons and the first respondent points to Order 3 of the Rules of the Superior Courts (‘RSC’, as amended, whereby the classes of claims in which that procedure may be adopted include ‘(1) The administration of the real or personal estate of a deceased person,… save where there is a charge of wilful default….’</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The respondent ultimately relies on the following passage from Scanlon, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Administration and Mortgage Suits</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Dublin, 1963) at p. 65:</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">‘Executors, administrators and trustees are entitled to their costs out of the estate as a matter of course unless a charge of misconduct is established and then, and only then, do such costs become discretionary and the solicitor for a party in default is in no better position as regards costs than his client.’</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. Two authorities are relied upon by Scanlon for the proposition that an administratrix is entitled to her costs out of the estate as a matter of course unless a charge of misconduct is established against her. The first is O. LXV (65), r. 1(1) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (Ireland) 1905 (‘the 1905 Rules’). That Order of the 1905 Rules deals with the issue of costs. It is cast in substantially different terms to those of Order 99 of the RSC, the rule that now addresses that issue. The second is the following passage from </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daniell’s Chancery Practice</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, 8th edn. (London, 1914) (Vol. II, p. 1055): ‘Trustees, agents and receivers, accounting fairly, are entitled to their costs out of the estate, as a matter of course; and the same rule extends to personal representatives, to whom, as they can only obtain complete exoneration by having their accounts passed in the Court, the Court will give every opportunity of exonerating themselves by passing their accounts at the expense of the estate.’ </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. In an accompanying footnote, Daniell cites, as authority for that proposition, O. LXV. 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883 (for England and Wales ), which the Chancery Division of the High Court in that jurisdiction then acted upon in dealing with the costs of executors, administrators, trustees or mortgagees ‘who had not acted unreasonably or carried on or resisted any proceedings.’ That rule is significantly different in material part than O. LXV, r. 1(1) of the 1905 Rules. It need hardly be said that the former rule was never in force in this jurisdiction and the latter rule was long ago supplanted by a quite different one made under s. 22 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924, itself long since repealed and replaced by s. 14 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961. I do not accept that the present rules under O. 99 of the RSC, as amended, contain no provision capable of addressing the costs of an administration suit, such that, by operation of s. 14 of the 1961 Act, the jurisdiction of the Court in that regard requires to be exercised as nearly as possible in the same manner as it would have been under O. LXV, r. 1(1) of the 1905 Rules.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. Indeed, as Scanlon acknowledges (at p. 65), even in 1963, the modern position was that ‘[s]ubject to any limitation by statute or rule of Court the rights to costs and the scales thereof are in the discretion of the Court.’ That was the case then under O. 99, r. 1 of the RSC 1962 and it remains the case now under O. 99. r.1 of the current RSC, as amended. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The applicants submit that they brought their application by way of the special summons procedure under O. 3 of the RSC, as amended, to avoid the greater costs of a plenary action and point out that the first respondent did not object to that course, although she was undoubtedly entitled to do so, as her wilful default or misconduct in the administration of the estate was plainly in issue from the outset. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. For my part, I do not accept that the first respondent could foreclose any possibility of a finding of wilful default on her part as administratrix by the simple expedient of not objecting to the use of the special summons procedure as the appropriate vehicle for seeking her removal from that position. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Nor do I accept that there is any absolute or inflexible modern rule whereby an administratrix is entitled to her costs of an administration out of the estate unless a finding of misconduct, expressed as such, is made against her. I do accept that there is an obvious public interest in the application of a general principle whereby, once there is a reasonable ground for litigation by an administrator, executor or trustee, and once that litigation is conducted </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">bona fide</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, that party should have an order for his or her costs out of the estate or trust though unsuccessful in the action. The public interest concerned is a broader manifestation of that identified by Budd J. in the narrower context of the circumstances surrounding the execution of wills in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">In bonis Morelli: Vela v Morelli</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1968] I.R. 11 (at 34). That is to say, it is the wider public or community interest in the proper administration of estates and trusts generally. Administrators, executors or trustees should not be unduly deterred from seeking to have genuine problems or issues in the administration of any estate or trust judicially resolved because of the risk of a personal liability for the costs of the appropriate litigation.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. There is another relevant principle. It is that an application which bears all of the hallmarks of a hostile </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">lis inter partes</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> – whether between beneficiaries under a will, under a trust or on an intestacy – may, depending on all of the circumstances, attract the unvarnished application of the usual rule that costs follow the event. That is the principle that I understand Herbert J. to have identified in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O’Connor v Markey</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2007] 2 I.R. 194 and Laffoy J. to have applied in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rennick v Rennick</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2012] IEHC 589.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. In considering the correct principle to apply to the present application, it is necessary to recall the material findings in the underlying judgment and the conclusion based upon them. The material findings are that there has been what is, by any measure, an extraordinary delay in the administration of the deceased’s estate by the first respondent that has not been adequately explained (para. 19), and that the first respondent has failed in her fundamental duties as administratrix properly to gather in the property of the estate and properly to account to the beneficiaries of the estate for its assets and liabilities (para. 27). The conclusion based upon those findings is that each on its own demonstrates a want of proper capacity on the part of the first respondent to execute the duties of administratrix, amounting to a special circumstance warranting her removal from that position, which special circumstance is more evident still when they are considered in combination (para. 37). </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. On that basis, it seems to me that the second of the two principles I have just identified is the more pertinent to the determination of the application at hand. That is to say, the underlying action more clearly bears the hallmarks of a lis inter partes than it does the indicia of an action defended on reasonable grounds, and conducted </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">bona fide</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, by the first respondent as administratrix.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. I am buttressed in that conclusion by a consideration of the authority relied upon by Scanlon for the proposition contained in the second part of the passage already quoted, i.e. the position of a solicitor for a client in default as an administrator is no better than that of the client . The authority is </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Re O’Kean</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1907] 1 I.R. 223, a decision of Barton J. in the Chancery Division of the High Court, later affirmed by the Court of Appeal. In a curious echo of the present action, the case concerned a creditor’s suit for the administration of the estate of a deceased publican and trader who had carried on business in Newry, County Down. A brother of the d
