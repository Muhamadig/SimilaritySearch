             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Hedigan delivered on the 7th day of March 2016 </font></b> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The factual background</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Two appeals are brought before the court. The first deals with the substantive issue of admissibility of a certificate of conviction. It is brought on behalf of the defendant against the order of Kearns P. of the 1st March, 2013, directing that the conviction of the appellant for her husband&#x2019;s murder is admissible in the within proceedings as </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> evidence of the fact that she committed such murder. The appellant was convicted on the 11th April, 2000, in the Central Criminal Court of the murder and soliciting the murder of her husband, Thomas Nevin in 1996. The second appeal is brought by the defendant against the order of Kearns P of the 14th of February 2013 which refused the defendant&#x2019;s application for a stay on the hearing of the plaintiff&#x2019;s motion. This second appeal has become moot. I agree with the decision of Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan that it should be dismissed.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Dealing with the first appeal, the proceedings herein were instituted by plenary summons on the 4th November, 1997, and were brought by the deceased&#x2019;s mother and following her death have been maintained by the administrators of her estate, who are the brother and sister of Thomas Nevin. These proceedings seek various declarations in relation to the appellant&#x2019;s right to inherit from her husband&#x2019;s estate and damages for wrongful death. In particular the plaintiffs claim;-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;A Declaration that by virtue of Section 120 of the Succession Act, 1965 the Defendant is precluded from taking any share either as legal right or otherwise in the Estate of the said Deceased&#x201d; </font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The relevant provisions of the Succession Act 1965 are as follows:</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">s. 120(1) A sane person who has been guilty of the murder, attempted murder or manslaughter of another shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate of that other, except a share arising under a will made after the act constituting the offence, and shall not be entitled to make an application under section 117.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (4) A person who has been found guilty of an offence against the deceased, or against the spouse or any child of the deceased (including a child adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 and 1964, and a person to whom the deceased was in loco parentis at the time of the offence), punishable by imprisonment for a maximum period of at least two years or by a more severe penalty, shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate as a legal right or from making an application under section 117.</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The High Court on the 23rd January, 1998, ordered that no further steps be taken in these proceedings until the final determination of the criminal proceedings. These have now concluded. The appellant&#x2019;s defence and counterclaim was delivered in 2005. She denies therein that she murdered Thomas Nevin. A notice to admit facts was served dated 21st December 2011. Admissions were sought in relation to the following matters:</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) That the defendant was guilty of the murder of Thomas Nevin. To this the reply was that she denied any involvement in his death.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) That she was found guilty on 11th April, 2000, by a jury in the Central Criminal Court, of the murder of Thomas Nevin. The reply to this was that the defendant had and continues to challenge the verdict.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) That she was found guilty on three counts, under s. 4 of the offences against the Person Act, 1861, of soliciting persons to murder Thomas Nevin. To this she replied that she has always denied soliciting the murder.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(4) That the transcripts of the evidence adduced at trial before the Central Criminal Court contain evidence proving that on the balance of probabilities she was guilty of murdering and soliciting three persons to murder Thomas Nevin. This was not admitted.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(5) That the transcripts of the evidence adduced at trial in the Central Criminal Court contain evidence that she was guilty of murdering and soliciting three persons to murder Thomas Nevin. This was not admitted.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(6) That the Court of Criminal Appeal rejected her appeal on 14th March 2003, in a judgment delivered on that date by Mr. Justice Geoghegan and refused leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The defendant replied that this was correct but referred to answers 1,2 and 3.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(7) That the Court of Criminal Appeal rejected her application, pursuant to s. 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993, on 22nd November, 2010, in a judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Hardiman. She rreplied that this was correct but also referred to the replies to (1). (2) and (3).</font></p>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The Court has had the benefit of helpful written and oral submissions from the appellant and the respondents. Ms. Fitzgibbon, on behalf of the appellant, submitted that there were no cases on hearsay opened before Kearns P. No case was made, she argued, that any witnesses who could prove the respondents&#x2019; case were unavailable or incompetent. She submitted that the trial judge relied primarily on two things. First, the decision in </font>

This judgment did not in fact decide the core issue in this case, but only considered &#x2018;special circumstances&#x2019; under the Court of Probate Act 1857. It did not decide that the conviction was admissible as proof of guilt. The judge however did express such an opinion but as such it did not form part of the </font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">[1943] K.B. 587, in which the Court of Appeal for England and Wales held that the defendant&#x2019;s conviction for careless driving was not admissible in the civil action brought against him for negligence. In </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jorgensen </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">the evidence was admitted as an exception to the rule against hearsay. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. Ms. Fitzgibbon submitted that once it was decided that the certificate of conviction was a hearsay matter, then the court must go through the appropriate test to decide whether or not it could be admitted as an exception to the rule against hearsay. She argued that Kearns P. could not create an exception or classify it as such where he did not conduct inquiries regarded as essential according to Irish case law notably by Denham J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eastern Health Board v. M.K.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1999] 2 I.R. 99. She further submitted that the certificate of conviction does not fall into the public document exception to the rule against hearsay. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. Ms. Fitzgibbon further noted that the trial judge did not base his decision on issue estoppel or abuse of process. It was submitted that it could not be either of these things as there was no privity between the parties and the appellant is the defendant not the plaintiff in these proceedings. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. Ms. Fitzgibbon also submitted that these proceedings issued before the criminal proceedings and that the respondents were presumably in a position to prove their case at that point. She added that if the certificate of conviction was deemed admissible, it would be virtually impossible to defend the case. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Mr. Brady S.C., on behalf of the respondents, submitted that the appellant&#x2019;s criminal trial lasted 42 days, during which she gave evidence over the course of six days. He also noted that she had one of the foremost criminal defence counsel acting on her behalf. He referred to the judgment of Kearns P. and noted the criticism of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hollington</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the United Kingdom and throughout the world. Particular reference was made to the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jorgensen</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. He relied upon the statement therein of North P. that there must be exceptions to the hearsay rule and that it is for judges dealing with procedural matters to make exceptions and it does not really matter what it is called as it is a matter of procedure to ensure that justice is done. He referred this Court extensively to the judgment of Turner J. and to the remarks of McCarthy J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jorgensen</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. Mr. Brady submitted that these views were quite properly adopted by Kearns P. in his judgment. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. Mr. Brady submitted that the core issue in the High Court was whether the conviction of the appellant for the murder of her husband was admissible as </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> evidence of her guilt of that murder in the civil proceedings. He also submitted that he was arguing on general principles as opposed to an exception to hearsay. He noted further that the respondents&#x2019; pleadings cover both common law and s. 120 of the Succession Act 1965. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Mr. Brady submitted that the trial judge was correct in deciding the matter as he did either as an exception to the hearsay rule or on the basis that the certificate of conviction is a public document. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decision</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">13. The core issue for this Court is whether Kearns P. was correct in his finding that the conviction of the appellant was </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">admissible &#x201c;as prima facie evidence that Catherine Nevin murdered her husband&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. The plaintiff seeks to admit it as </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> evidence that the defendant murdered her husband. In his judgment at p. 59, he stated that:-</font> </p>

              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;I prefer to base my view ultimately on the proposition that the admissibility of the murder conviction is either authorised on foot of the decision in </font>

               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> case or comes within an exception to the hearsay rule as suggested and found by the Court of Appeal in New Zealand in Jorgensen&#x2019;s case.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">14. In </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Crippen&#x2019;s </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">case the Court was dealing with an application for a grant of administration of the estate of Crippen&#x2019;s wife. Mrs. Crippen was survived by her husband who had been convicted and executed for her murder. Prior to his execution, he appointed his mistress as his sole executrix and universal legatee of his will. Mrs. Crippen&#x2019;s sister sought a grant of letters of administration for her estate and to pass over the legal representative of the husband. The Court held that the murder conviction was a special circumstance under s. 73 of the Court of Probate Act 1857, so that the husband&#x2019;s legal personal representative could be passed over. It was held by Evans P. at pp. 111 to 112 that:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;In the present case a man who has been convicted of the wilful murder of his wife has, after his conviction, made a will appointing a person his executrix and universal legatee, who claims, as such executrix, to administer the murdered wife&#x2019;s estate, and as legatee to be entitled to the murdered wife&#x2019;s property. </font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are, surely, &#x2018;special circumstances&#x2019;. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I therefore pass over and decline to appoint the executrix; and I appoint the applicant as attorney of the deceased woman&#x2019;s sister to be administrator of the deceased woman&#x2019;s estate on the sister&#x2019;s behalf.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">15. Evans P. stated that he believed there was nothing else necessary for him to decide before using his discretion to determine the motion. However, he went on to say that in case he was wrong in this regard, he would state his views on the points raised in argument. At p. 115 of his judgment Evans P. stated that:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;In my opinion, where a convicted felon, or the personal representative of a convicted murderer who has been executed, brings any civil proceeding to establish claims, or to enforce rights, which result to the felon, or to the convicted testator from his own crime, the conviction is admissible in evidence, not merely as proof of the conviction, but also as presumptive proof of the commission of the crime.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Thus it is clear that as submitted to the Court by Ms. Fitzgibbon, insofar as the issue of admissibility of the conviction for murder goes, the statement of Evans P. was </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">obiter dictum</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. Over 40 years later, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hollington</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the Court of Appeal for England and Wales held that the defendant&#x2019;s conviction for careless driving was not admissible in the civil action brought against him for negligence. This decision was subsequently subject to severe criticism. The very Court of Appeal where the decision was given expressed subsequently its regret at being bound by it. Law reform bodies charged with inquiring into it have reported adversely and the writing of jurists throughout the Common Law world have nearly all condemned its reasoning and its conclusion. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. In 1969, the New Zealand Court of Appeal in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jorgensen</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> departed from the line of authority which had developed in England following the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hollington </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">decision. It held that the certificate of conviction was admissible evidence. In that particular case, Jorgensen had brought a libel claim based on a statement published in the defendant&#x2019;s newspaper in 1967 to the effect that Jorgensen along with another man had, in 1963, machine gunned one Kevin Speight, whose body was found in a house with another gunshot victim. Both men were convicted of the murder of Kevin Speight in 1964 and their appeals against their convictions were dismissed. During the trial of the libel action the judge followed the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hollington</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and subsequent English Court of Appeal decisions. He held that the conviction was not admissible as evidence that Jorgensen had murdered Speight, but was admissible in relation to the mitigation of damages. The jury was unable to agree and were discharged. Before the commencement of the second trial, a case was stated seeking clarity on this issue. Thus it was that the case came before the New Zealand Court of Appeal. In its judgment at p. 979, North P. stated that:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;In the present case, on the other hand, there is already a body of judicial opinion that would justify the conclusion that a certificate of conviction is not merely conclusive evidence that Jorgensen had been found guilty of the murder of Speight but was admissible evidence as well in proof of the fact of guilt and that is as far as I feel obliged to go.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">19. In relation to the decision in Hollington, Turner J. at p. 990 as to the certificate of conviction being hearsay evidence stated as follows:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;It is true that to admit a certificate of conviction as proof of guilt is to admit hearsay, but the objection to the admission of hearsay is fundamentally this and no more: (a) the version of the facts given in the Court may not be an accurate transcription of what the original witness said at all; (b) even if correctly recorded, the content of what is said may be unsatisfactory &#x2013; i.e. false, unreliable, biased, prejudiced, etc. -- and there is no opportunity to demonstrate this by cross-examination of the maker of the statement. Neither of these objections seems to me to apply, or at least to apply in any great degree, to the admissibility of a certificate of conviction. If there is any document whose content must be taken as satisfactorily verified it must be a certificate under the seal of the Court. There can I think be no real doubt that a certificate of conviction under the seal of the Court constitutes unimpeachable evidence not only of the fact that the prisoner was convicted, but also of the fact that the Court did in fact consider him guilty of the crime charged. So much for that objection. As regards the other (viz. that the opinion of the Court might have been wrong) it is perhaps only necessary to say that before a man be convicted in this country the Court must have come to the conclusion beyond all reasonable doubt that he was guilty of the crime charged. It does not seem to me, therefore, that either of the reasons normally operating to exclude hearsay exert any logical force at all in this case, and I would not allow the fact that a certificate of conviction is technically hearsay to deter me from the proposal which I now make, that this Court should abrogate the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">20. In reliance upon this judgment, Kearns P. stated at p. 45 of his judgment as follows:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Even if I had not found the reasoning of the New Zealand Court of Appeal as convincing as I do, I would nonetheless start from the position that decisions of English courts constitute persuasive authority only since this State gained its independence. While decisions of the superior courts in the United Kingdom can be highly persuasive, I am satisfied, principally by reference to the reasoning offered by the Court of Appeal in New Zealand, that the decision in </font>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hollington v. Hewthorn</font></i>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> is unsatisfactory both for the reasons enumerated in Jorgensen, the writings of distinguished commentators referred to therein and in the citati
