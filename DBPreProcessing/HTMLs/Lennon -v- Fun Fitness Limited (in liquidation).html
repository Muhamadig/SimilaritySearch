             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Barr delivered on the 28th day of February, 2017 </font></b> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Preliminary </font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. In this action, the plaintiff seeks damages from the defendant, her employer, in respect of an accident which occurred on 29th October, 2011. Since that time, the defendant company was put into liquidation. By order of the High Court dated 7th March, 2016, the plaintiff was given liberty to continue the proceedings which she had issued, against the company. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. By further order of the court dated 9th May, 2016, it was ordered that the defendant&#x2019;s defence be struck out for failure to comply with s. 14(2) of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004. It was further ordered that the plaintiff should recover against the defendant, such amount as the Court may assess in respect of the plaintiff&#x2019;s claim for damages. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. On 31st January, 2017, the plaintiff&#x2019;s solicitor sent a copy of the notice of trial dated 27th January, 2017, to the liquidator of the defendant company, and to its insurers, who had earlier refused cover in respect of any liability that the defendant may have to the plaintiff. By email dated 31st January, 2017, the liquidator indicated that he would not be taking any steps to defend the action on behalf of the company. By email dated 3rd February, 2017, the defendant&#x2019;s insurers sent an email to the plaintiff&#x2019;s solicitor informing him that the insurers had no involvement in the proceedings, as indemnity had been refused by them to the defendant in respect of the claim brought by the plaintiff. They indicated that they would not have any involvement in the proceedings. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. By letters dated 8th February, 2017, the plaintiff&#x2019;s solicitor wrote informing the liquidator and the defendant&#x2019;s insurers that the action was due for hearing before the High Court in Dublin on 10th February, 2017. There was no appearance by the liquidator, or by any representative on behalf of the defendant&#x2019;s insurers, when the matter was called over at the call over of the List at 10:30hrs on 10th February, 2017. Neither party appeared before this Court when the action commenced later that day. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. In the circumstances outlined above, the court is satisfied that the plaintiff has obtained a judgment in default as against the defendant and is entitled to have her damages assessed by this Court. The Court is further satisfied that the liquidator and the company&#x2019;s insurers were given adequate notice of the proposed hearing date and had clearly indicated their intention not to appear to contest the proceedings. Accordingly, it was appropriate for the Court to proceed to assess the plaintiff&#x2019;s damages in the absence of any representative of the liquidator, or the defendant&#x2019;s insurers. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Substantive Claim</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. This action arises out of an accident which occurred on 29th October, 2011, when the plaintiff was employed by the defendant company as a part-time supervisor at a children&#x2019;s play centre operated by the defendant from a premises known as Fun Fitness, Total Fitness Complex, Sandyford, Co. Dublin. The accident happened at the end of the day at approximately 18:00hrs, when the plaintiff was asked by a manager to go to the disabled toilet and to turn off the power switch for the hand dryer at that location. The plaintiff went to the toilet and while walking across the floor thereof, she was caused to slip and fall to the ground due to the presence of water or other liquid on the floor surface. She fell to the ground and landed heavily on her outstretched left hand. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. As the plaintiff has already obtained a default judgment as against the defendant, it is not necessary to make any determination on the question of liability. The allegations of negligence as contained in her personal injury summons, are taken as having been proved. The court is only concerned with the assessment of the plaintiff&#x2019;s damages arising from the injuries sustained in the accident. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. After the plaintiff fell onto the floor, she got up and made her way to the reception area, where she was put sitting on a chair. When she had composed herself, she was able to drive home to her fiancé&#x2019;s house. She stated that her left wrist was very sore at this time and she found it very difficult to operate the gears on her car and had to drive home in second gear. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. When she arrived at her fiancé&#x2019;s house, she was not able to unbuckle her seatbelt due to severe pain in the left wrist and hand. Her fiancé freed her from the seatbelt. Later that night, his father brought her to the Accident and Emergency Department of St. Michael&#x2019;s Hospital, Dun Laoghaire. She was detained there for approximately four to five hours. An x-ray was taken which revealed no evidence of fracture in the wrist or hand. She was referred for physiotherapy treatment. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The plaintiff had physiotherapy treatment approximately twice per month for a year. She was also sent for a second x-ray, which confirmed that there was no fracture. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. The plaintiff was seen by Mr. Varian, Consultant Hand Surgeon, at the Blackrock Clinic, on 23rd November, 2011. At that time, she was wearing a wrist brace on her left wrist. She had also hurt her elbow in the accident, but it had since cleared up. When she saw Mr. Varian, she complained that if she worked for longer than thirty minutes, her left hand would swell. She found that she could not wear rings on her left hand due to swelling. She also complained of a general achiness in the left hand. There was tenderness around the ball of the thumb of the left hand. She also reported that at any time during the day, the tips of the index and middle fingers and the thumb could go numb. This numbness would last for about twenty-five minutes. It occurred approximately once, or up to four times, per day. She also complained of an intermittent burning sensation in the hand that could last up to one hour. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Mr. Varian noted that it was quite soon after the accident. On physical examination, he found tenderness and limitation of movement of the wrist. Mr. Varian was of opinion that the plaintiff&#x2019;s history of intermittent of numbness and burning sensation in the hand, were consistent with nerve sensitivity in the carpal tunnel, meaning that there was early compression of the median nerve causing a condition called carpel tunnel syndrome. This condition could be caused by morbid obesity, regardless of any injury. He advised that it should be investigated by means of nerve conduction studies. He did not expect there to be any permanent residual disability, but it was too early to give a definitive prognosis. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. After the accident, the plaintiff was rendered unfit for her part-time work at the defendant&#x2019;s premises. Some short time later, she was let go by the defendant. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. At the time of the accident, she was in her second year of marketing studies in college. She was able to take a sabbatical from her studies for approximately one month. Thereafter, a decision was made that she would pursue a degree which was confined to academic work only. This meant that she lost the video production major which she had been doing as part of her degree. This was necessary due to the fact that as part of that elective, she would have to handle heavy cameras and heavy lighting equipment. She was not able to do that. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The plaintiff completed her degree in 2012, which was a degree in Communications. She did not have the hours built up in relation to video production, so she could not apply for jobs in video production or TV work. This was a matter of disappointment for her. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. After she obtained her degree, she worked in marketing for a recruitment firm. She then changed job and is currently employed doing marketing work for a software company.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. The plaintiff was reviewed by Mr. Colin Riordan, Consultant Hand and Plastic Surgeon, at the Blackrock Clinic on 1st April, 2014. At that time, she complained that the tips of her fingers in her right hand occasionally felt numb. There was a &#x201c;pins and needles&#x201d; sensation in the fingers of her right hand on waking. Her hand would go into spasm if she had to lift or carry anything heavy, or following typing for long periods. She experienced the odd ache in her arm, which radiated up to her neck. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. Examination on that date was confined to the left hand. There was no evidence of gross deformity or swelling. The median nerve pressure test, which was a provocative test for the presence of carpel tunnel syndrome, was weekly positive. There was no evidence of objective sensory impairment and the plaintiff demonstrated a full range of movement in the hand and wrist. There was no instability present in the wrist and hand and no residual tenderness on palpation of the wrist. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. Mr. Riordan noted that the plaintiff had suffered an injury to her non-dominant left wrist in the fall in October 2011. There was no evidence of there being any bony injury, or fracture, but a few weeks after the injury, the plaintiff developed the presence of paraesthesia in her hand. These symptoms had persisted. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. Mr. Riordan was of opinion that the plaintiff&#x2019;s symptoms were suggestive of the presence of carpel tunnel syndrome. He thought that it merited further investigation with nerve conduction studies. He noted that carpel tunnel syndrome was a common condition present in the population at large, generally considered constitutional, but there was an association with trauma, particularly if it was severe, resulting in fracture or crush injury. He noted that apart from some light symptoms of sensitivity present in the hand, there was no measurable loss of function. The plaintiff was fit to continue with her pre-accident occupation. </font> </p>
