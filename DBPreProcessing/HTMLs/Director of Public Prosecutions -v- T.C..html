             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The Young Defendant [child] TC was born in early 2000. He currently resides with his mother, [O], and an older sister in a Bed and Breakfast accommodation in Dublin, but otherwise is effectively homeless. The family have a long history of homelessness. TC parents are separated and there is a history of criminality in some members of the extended family.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. TC attended school until his Junior Certificate [an educational qualification awarded in Ireland by the Department of Education and Skills to students who have successfully completed the junior cycle of secondary education, and achieved a minimum standard in their Junior Certification]. Although a pleasant and engaged student of average ability his attendance at school was a continuing problem owing to the family&#x2019;s fractured living arrangements.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. TC was initially refused bail by the Children Court following his appearance in court in regards to an incident on the 8 November 2016. He is currently on Bail due to both his and his mother&#x2019;s engagement with the Extern Bail Supervision Scheme. Extern, is a social justice charity which was awarded a contract by the Irish Youth Justice Service [which operates as through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs] to deliver a &#x2018;Bail Supervision Scheme&#x2019;. Currently, this is a pilot scheme in the Children Court Dublin, working alongside the Irish Youth Justice Service, to ensure young people on bail and their families are supported through a dedicated scheme to address their needs. The scheme provides an intensive support through the use of Multisytemic Therapy (MST), an Evidence-Based approach, which seeks to understand the factors that contribute to the young person&#x2019;s behaviour. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. MST is an internationally recognised Evidence Based Programme. MST interventions starts out by identifying the causes of offending, and then builds itself around treating them. It is called &#x201c;multi-systemic&#x201d; because it works across the different social systems that the young person moved in; family, school, peer group and community. MST addresses risk factors that lead to offending, and works with the family as well as the offender, coming to the family&#x2019;s environment in their time, and asking what the family needs. It works in the four social environments of the young person being family, school, peer group and community. It works in the community with chronic young offenders who are detention bound. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. Since being admitted to Bail JC has worked well with the Bail Support Scheme.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. JC has also attended a Dublin based Youthreach for five days a week [Monday&#x2013;Friday] since early 2017. Youthreach is a Department of Education and Skills official education, training and work experience programme for early school leavers aged 15&#x2013;20. It offers young people the opportunity to identify options within adult life, and provides them with opportunities to acquire certification.</font><br> </p>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. In this case, TC was driving a scrambler motorbike on a public road in Dublin and hit a Volkswagen car while over-taking before he collided head on with a Toyota Avensis. The car he hit was driven by a mother who had her husband and their two young children, aged four and eleven as passengers. The Motorbike came though the windows of the car in the collision. The victims didn&#x2019;t wish to give a victim impact statement to the Court, but Garda Masterson informed the Court that while no one was injured, the children were very upset and their was extensive damage to the car resulting in it being a &#x201c;write -off&#x201d;. The owners had only third party insurance policy and are not covered financially for the loss of the car. </font><br> </p>

When approached by a Garda Síochána car, TC drove dangerously around a housing estate for twenty minutes before entering the M50 Motorway. TC had consumed a significant amount of tablets that evening.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. According to the Gardaí, the Gardaí spotted two cars driving on the wrong side of the road at the Little Pace roundabout in Clonee. The Gardaí took up pursuit at which the two cars split up. TC was driving a 02 REG HONDA Xtreme and drove at speed through another roundabout on the wrong side of/. He sped through a red light forcing a taxi to take evasive action. He crossed several lanes without regard for other road users and he did this several times. He nearly lost control of the Honda several times. TC drove along the M50 slip road and then he crossed the motorway drivers had to take evasive action. As he reached the M50 toll bridge he was &#x201c;boxed in&#x201d; and stopped. He initially resisted arrest, but then became compliant and he was handcuffed and taken to Blanchardstown Hospital .The Victim didn&#x2019;t wish to give a victim statement but Garda Phelan informed the court that the stolen car had been hot wired and the owner was not initially aware it had been stolen . As a result of this incident the car was a &#x201d;write off&#x201c;. The offences were committed while TC was on bail on other charges.</font><br> </p>

The owner of the car in this case informed the Court very movingly that the consequences of the loss of the car meant she had no car for a considerable period. At the time of the incident, her husband was seriously ill in hospital. Her husband subsequently died and she attended court on the first anniversary of his death. </font><br> </p>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. A woman&#x2019;s Honda Car was stolen in Dublin. Just after 11.30 p.m. the Gardaí on patrol saw the stolen car being driven at speed by the defendant on the N3 in Dublin. The teenager broke red lights and collided with a Volkswagen Golf driven by the Priest, a Parish Priest. The defendant ran from the car, but was arrested close by. The Priest suffered broken ankles and a hairline fractures on the top his knee. He spent six weeks in hospital and is not fully recovered. The incident occurred while TC was on Bail on other charges.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. In a moving impact statement to the court the Priest stated that he was aware that TC was involved and a number of road traffic accidents and in his view </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;the decisions to act or not around that impacted and continue to impact directly on&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him. He stated the firstly he is conscious that a family have been deprived of their car, the driver was uninsured which makes it difficult for insurance purposes for claims. He noted that TC fled the scene of the accident after he was injured. From a work point of view he was unable to attend funerals, officiate at weddings, attend confirmation enrolments, attend school activities, visit the sick at Christmas and couldn&#x2019;t attend his parish for ten weeks. He remains uncertain as to when he can resume his official duties. Due to a hospital appointment he recently wasn&#x2019;t able to attend a funeral that he wanted to attend.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. On a personal basis he feels he inconvenienced many people with various hospital appointments. He missed holidays planned and booked with family and friends. He can&#x2019;t play golf and this has an effect his own leisure time. He is very conscious of the hospital expenses and has a heightened awareness of road accidents which will remain a constant reminder to him. He acknowledges that these cases are complex. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SENTENCING GENERAL PRINCIPLES</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">18. Justice and welfare concerns are issues in any juvenile sentencing in criminal law matters. A welfare concern focuses on the child&#x2019;s needs and rehabilitation rather than the establishment of criminal responsibility. A justice model promotes children rights, but it also has the potential to be excessively punitive and it has the potential to pay insufficient attention to a child's capacity and childhood issues.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. Tom O&#x2019;Malley B.L, one of the leading academics on sentencing law in Ireland, stated in &#x2018;Sentencing Law and Practice&#x2019; Round Hall [3rd edition] 2016 at page 247:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The present orthodoxy, as reflected in both the United Nations Convention on the rights of the Child and the Children Act 2001, is that pre-trial procedures should be governed primarily by an ethos of justice but that welfare considerations should predominate once a child is adjudged guilty.&#x201d;</font></i>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">20. The Benchmark against which Children Court sentencing is set is that of international standards, but in particular the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 [U.N.C.R.C] as unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly Convention on the Rights of the Child on 20 November 1989 and which entered into force and became legally binding on States Parties in September 1990. Ireland ratified U.N.C.R.C. in 1992.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21. In relation to U.N.C.R.C. Article 2 prohibits discrimination between children on any ground. Article 3 states the best interests of the child must be the primary consideration in all actions relating to a child. Article 12 recognises the right of a child to express his/her views, having regard to the age and maturity of the child. Article 42A of the Constitution of Ireland also states the views of the child shall be ascertained and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child. Article 37 provides </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;the arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Article 40 provides extensive guidance on juvenile justice and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;recognizes the right of every child alleged as, accused of, or recognized as having infringed the penal law to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child's sense of dignity and worth, which reinforces the child's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and which takes into account the child's age and the desirability of promoting the child's reintegration and the child's assuming a constructive role in society.&#x201d;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Article 40(4) recognises the principle of proportionality and that alternative measures are available in order &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">to ensure that children are dealt with in a manner appropriate to their well being and proportionate both to their circumstances and the offence.&#x201d;</font></i> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22. The Best interest of the child is a central concept in international and domestic juvenile justice systems. For example the Committee on the Rights of the Child General Comment No 10 (2007) on juvenile justice states at paragraph 10:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Children differ from adults in their physical and psychological development, and their emotional and educational needs. Such differences constitute the basis for the lesser culpability of children in conflict with the law. These and other differences are the reasons for a separate juvenile system and require a different treatment for children. The protection of the best interests of the child means, for instance, that the traditional objectives of criminal justice, such as repression/retribution, must give way to rehabilitation and restorative justice objectives in dealing with child offenders. This can be done in concert with attention to effective public safety.&#x201d;</font></i>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">23. The United Nations [U.N.] have also provided guidelines in the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice [&#x201c;The Beijing Rules&#x201d;], the UN Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty and in the UN Standard Minimum Rules for Non-Custodial Measures [&#x201c;The Tokyo Rules&#x201d;]. At European level, the European Convention on Human Rights [E.C.H.R] was enacted into Irish Law subject to Irish Constitution by the European Convention of Human Rights Act 2003 are also relevant to juvenile sentencing. In particular Article 6 of the European Convention and Article 38 of Bunreacht na hÉireann [Constitution of Ireland] ensure that courts in all cases, including Children&#x2019;s Court, should follow fair procedures in a trial.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">24. In the recent Supreme case of Conway -v- Ireland, the Attorney General &amp; ors [2017] IESC 13 Mr. Justice Frank Clarke re - stated existing Irish law that Article 29.6 of the Irish Constitution provides that no international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State save as determined by the Oireachtas. However he also stated that the European Union Law [EU] in that case may be applicable or influence the proper interpretation of existing Irish law which needs to be considered on its merits. That case was concerned with EU which doesn&#x2019;t arise in this case but it is reasonable to interpret that in this context of existing UN and European Conventions and Agreements signed by Ireland the same principles would be considered </font> </p>

             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the Principles are heavily biased towards the rehabilitation as distinct from the punishment of child offenders.

A sentence in the Children Court in conformity with international and domestic law strives where possible to divert children away from custody and respond to the issues of the child, of the victims, and of the community. In this regard, the seriousness of the offence is the starting point for sentence and the Court has to consider the child&#x2019;s culpability in committing the offence, the effect of the offence on his victims and the degree that which the intent in committing the offences were foreseeable bearing in mind the age and maturity of the child. However, there are other factors which must also be considered.</font> </p>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">29. The Irish Court of Criminal Appeal examined the weight that should be attributed to the age of the offender when sentencing for a serious offence. In </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">D.P.P. v. D.G</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2005] I.E.C.C.A. 75 (Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 27 May 2005), the appellant had been convicted of murder. He was fifteen years old when he killed another young boy and at the age of sixteen years was sentenced for same. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment subject to review by the Court in 2014. The Court of Criminal Appeal found that the trial judge had taken into account the age of the offender at the time he committed the offence. It noted that a person of the age of fifteen years was </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;by definition, immature, being a significant number of years from adulthood</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; and that specific regard should be had to the prospect of rehabilitation. The Court of Criminal Appeal observed that </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;each case will depend on its own particular circumstances and especially the age of the offender at the time when the crime was committed&#x201d;. </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">The Court also stated that children who are convicted of serious offences that ordinarily involve long custodial sentences should be considered as a &#x201c;special category&#x201d; in that an important onus lies upon the Court to have regard to their rehabilitation and welfare because of their young age. </font>

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">31. Victims and the public also need to be reassured that the Court&#x2019;s are prepared to treat the matters seriously. In this regard the Courts notes</font><font size="2" color="#4F4F4F" face="Verdana"> </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Directive 2012/29/EU</font><font size="2" color="#4F4F4F" face="Verdana"> </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">(the Victims&#x2019; Rights Directive), establishing minimum standards on the rights, supports and protections of victims of crime, was brought into force. In practice in the Children Court Victims are allowed to give a Victim Impact Statement to the Court or communicate their interests in accordance with section 96 (5) of the Children Act 2001 and where applicable this has been provided for in this case. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">32. The Children&#x2019;s Court is pro-active in promoting restorative Justice such as for example Family Conferencing which arises under section 78 of the Children Act 2001. Where relevant in a particular case this can be beneficial to both the child and victims. It is the view of the Probation Service and of this Court that Family Conferencing is not appropriate in this case due the multiplicity of charges, the particular child&#x2019;s circumstances and the general facts of the case. However, any probation element of sentencing will take into account the child's victims and their injuries and loss suffered. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">33. Any sentence for a child must, unless otherwise determined by statute, be individualistic and focused on the child.

                <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;While the seriousness of the offence will be the starting point, the approach to sentencing should be individualistic and focused on the child or young person, as opposed to offence focused.

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">35. The Children Act 2001 and the Irish Courts follow the international concepts of proportionality of sentencing and the individualising of sentences for children. In this regard, the Children Court in general is mindful that many children have particular vulnerabilities such as speech and language, educational [including learning], mental health, capacity, abuse, attachment and other childhood issues. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">36. Many children such as this child appearing before the Children Court have particular issues and experience poor accommodation and in this case homelessness, poor parental employment, experience of considerable family association with criminal offending, neglect, negative peer group, and a substantial misuse of drugs. These issues are not an excuse for a crime, but they are important factors in deciding the appropriate sentence. A welfare model in sentencing should not therefore be a penal welfare sentence, but should where appropriate promote re- integration rather than retribution. Children such as this child who are exposed to criminality at an early stage run a risk of a further contaminating influence in a custodial context. The effect of a custodial sentence on child can have disproportionate impact on a child, but at all times recognising that there are cases where this threshold of custody can arise. However, in these cases the Court has to also balance the seriousness of the offence with the vulnerability factors and in particular the effect of children in closed conditions which could exacerbate any underlying issues including the risks to self harm.</font> </p>

Section 144 of the Act of 2001 provides subject to certain specified requirements within that section the Court may defer the making of a detention order. Before making this order, the Court must be satisfied that detention is the only suitable way of dealing with a child and after hearing evidence from a parent or guardian that it would be in the interests of justice to defer a detention order. If a place is not available for a child in a children detention school or for any other sufficient reason the Court may also make a deferred detention order.
