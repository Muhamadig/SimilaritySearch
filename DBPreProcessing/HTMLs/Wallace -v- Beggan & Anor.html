             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Tony O&#x2019;Connor delivered on the 17th day of February, 2017</font></b> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Introduction</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The defendants have requested that I recuse myself from hearing their applications pursuant to a Notice of Motion issued on 3rd June, 2016 seeking in terms which I abbreviate to the following:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) a declaration that the deeds appointing the plaintiff as a receiver are invalid and have no legal effect;</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) an order striking out the plaintiff&#x2019;s action pursuant to O. 21(15) of the Rules of the Superior Courts (&#x201c;RSC&#x201d;) which provides that where an action of the plaintiff is dismissed, the defendants counter claim may still proceed; </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) an order for an inquiry as to costs and losses pursuant to O. 33(2) of the RSC which allows the Court at any stage to direct inquiries or accounts to be taken;</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) a declaration that the plaintiff was at all material times the agent of ACC Loan Management Limited (&#x201c;ACC&#x201d;);</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v) an order granting the defendants liberty to bring a counter claim against the plaintiff &#x201c;and \ or his appointing bank&#x201d; (ACC) pursuant to O. 19(2) of the RSC (which concerns a set-off) and O. 24(2) of the RSC (which concerns a ground of defence arising pending an action). </font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The applications of the defendants are due to be heard on 8th March, 2017 in the Chancery List. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. I am one of a number of judges assigned to hear applications and cases in the Chancery List for Hilary Term, 2017. Gilligan J. who is the &#x201c;judge in charge&#x201d; of the Chancery List has already refused the defendants&#x2019; application to recuse himself in an </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ex tempore</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> judgment delivered on 1st February, 2017. That application was grounded upon the same Notice of Motion issued on 20th December, 2016 which is relied upon by the defendants in this recusal application. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The judge who is the subject of a recusal application initially determines whether he or she should recuse himself or herself. There is of course a right of appeal and such an appeal most recently occurred in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#x2019;Driscoll v. Hurley and Health Service Executive</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IESC 32. There, the Supreme Court determined an appeal by the appellant in the Court of Appeal who was unsuccessful in an application for one of the appeal court judges to recuse herself on the grounds of objective bias. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Grounds for refusal</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The first named defendant in his affidavit sworn on 20th December, 2016 averred that the plaintiff has an &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">unfair and decisive</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; advantage due to the determination in my judgment delivered on 2nd March, 2016 in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Farrell v. Petroysan</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IEHC 522 (&#x201c;the Petroysan judgment&#x201d;). </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Apprehension</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The first named defendant averred to his &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">strong apprehension</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; that both Gilligan J. and I &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">have pre-judged the effect of the McCleary v. McPhillips judgment [2015] IEHC 591</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; due to the judgment of Gilligan J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fennell v. Gilroy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ex tempore</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> judgment of 20th April, 2016) which mentioned the Petroysan judgment in the context of the ratification of an agent&#x2019;s authority retrospectively. </font> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ACC</font></b> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. Mr. Maher, solicitor for the defendants, submitted that the recusal application which is the subject of this judgment was indeed based on an objective standard of reasonable apprehension about whether there could be a fair and impartial hearing. He submitted that my judgment in Petroysan gave little prospect of a successful challenge to a resolution of ACC giving retrospective effect to an appointment of a receiver if the defendants&#x2019; application was heard by me whether on 8th March, 2017 or on some other date. Mr. Maher contended that my previous determination of a significant issue in the defendants&#x2019; application relating to ACC, albeit in an application by parties other than the defendants, indicated to an objective and informed person that the defendants could be deprived of an impartial hearing. </font> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Informed Person</font></b> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. Using the words of the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">An Garda Síochána. v. Penfield Enterprises Limited</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IECA 141 at para. 59 and those of Denham C.J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goode Concrete v. CRH</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] 2 I.L.R.M. 289 at para. 54 on p. 309, I ask whether a reasonable, objective and informed person would think that regardless of my declaration pursuant to Art. 34.6.1 of the Constitution to administer justice without fear or favour, I could provide an impartial hearing free of pre-judgment, hostility or prejudice to the defendants or their arguments? </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. Mr. Maher, solicitor, in his submissions clarified that his client defendants did not allege bias on my part. He stated that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for me to find in a way which would contradict my finding in the Petroysan judgment. There is no suggestion that I have made a comment about the defendants or their conduct. I also assure the parties that I know little of these proceedings because I have only read the following relating to what appear to be the substantive issues:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) the Notice of Motion issued on 3rd June, 2016 setting out the reliefs which are set out at the beginning of this judgment;</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) the Notice of Motion issued on 20th December, 2016 seeking orders that Gilligan J. and myself be recused; and</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) The affidavit of the first named defendant which avers to his &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">strong apprehension</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;. </font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Furthermore, it is not alleged nor is it a fact that I have any actual or potential pecuniary interest involving the parties directly or indirectly. </font>
             <br> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Novel application</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">11. Ms. Smith, counsel for the plaintiff, characterised this application as &#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">utterly novel</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; and that it exhibited a lack of understanding of the common law system for administering justice. Ms. Smith, correctly in my view, explained that it was the task of lawyers to consider and differentiate facts for the application of legal principles. Moreover, a finding about the applicable law in one set of proceedings does not preclude the Court from hearing submissions on the identical or similar legal issue. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. In this regard I mention the judgment of Finlay Geoghegan J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#x2019;Riordan v. O&#x2019;Connor</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2005] 1 I.R. 551 at 560 where the learned judge in the final paragraph highlighted how different submissions and authorities persuaded her to depart from her earlier decision on the point of law arising:-</font> </p>

              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;I am aware that the final conclusion in this judgment is contrary to that reached in an ex-tempore decision given by me in the Monday motion list on the 26th July, 2004, in Sarth Investments Ltd. (in receivership and liquidation). The issues were considered in greater detail in the submissions in this application and I reserved my decision. Whilst I regret the inconsistency, having considered the submissions made and authorities to which I was referred consider I am bound to so decide.&#x201d;</font></i>
