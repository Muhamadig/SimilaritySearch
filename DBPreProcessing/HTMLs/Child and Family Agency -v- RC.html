             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. I heard evidence in this application to extend a Care Order made under section 18 (2) of the Child Care Act by a presiding District Court judge. The case is about a Child who shall be referred to in this decision as &#x201c;Child C&#x201d; as nothing must be reported concerning this case which would serve to identify the child or the parents who are the subject of these proceedings. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The child&#x2019;s parents are the first and second named Respondent and only the second named Respondent has participated in the current proceedings. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The first named Respondent was the only parent present in court and represented in the original proceeding for a Care Order which were determined by the Court in 2015. However, at the hearing of the case brought by the Child and Family Agency to extend the Care Order which came before me there was no appearance by or on behalf of the mother. Both parents were in court for the delivery of the judgement.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The child&#x2019;s separate interests in the proceedings were highlighted by the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Guardian ad Litem</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, who was also represented by his solicitor. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. I am satisfied that service of the proceedings on each of the parents was duly affected and I am satisfied that the Dublin Metropolitan District has jurisdiction to hear this application.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">BACKGROUND</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. There is a lengthy history to this matter which was outlined in the course of the Summary of Facts contained in the written decision of the Presiding District Court Judge in 2015. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The Care Order made in respect of Child C was for a period slightly in excess of 18 months to enable the mother to address the issues in order to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;get her act together and stabilize her life so that she could regain custody of Child C.&#x201d;</font></i> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. To address the proportionality of the duration of the Order while balancing the rights of the parents and Child C, the Court provided for a full review several months from the date of that Order. It was provided that in the event that the mother did not take significant steps on the path outlined in the decision of the Presiding District Court Judge at the Review stage the Applicants should apply for an extension of the period of the Care Order at that time. The rationale was that this would provide the mother with a real goal in terms of turning her life around. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. There was no appearance by the father in the context of the hearing before the Presiding District Court Judge delivered in 2015. However, the father appeared in court before me seeking that the Court give him a period to address his issues and asking that the Court not make an Order in respect of Child C until she attains the age of eighteen years at this time.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The father&#x2019;s position was stated to be that he has now separated from the mother and has gained traction on his addiction issues. His evidence was that he is now clear of all substances having detoxed in a relatives home over the Christmas holiday period. He stated that his relationship with the mother ended before the Christmas holidays and he returned to his parents&#x2019; home. He regretted his lack of engagement with the Social Work Department and his failure to make arrangements to attend access with his child for the last eighteen months. In essence, he seeks time to put his life in order now and demonstrates his capacity to be a parent to his child.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. The mother did not appear and was not represented in these proceedings. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. The Child and Family Agency has applied for a Care Order in respect of Child C until she is eighteen years and this application is supported by the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Guardian ad Litem</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. The Guardian&#x2019;s evidence was that if the parents or either of them had been working in partnership with the Child and Family Agency and evidenced a capacity to change their lifestyle and engage consistently in attending access with their child he might have supported the making of a shorter order, however, neither parent had in fact taken any such steps. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. Child C has been living with her foster carers since she was an infant. Her experience of neglect in the care of her parents had considerable impact on her when she was placed in foster care and her demeanour and affect have improved greatly since the date of placement. She is now meeting all her milestones and is doing well and has access to her maternal grandmother, but not with either of her parents. She has formed a close attachment to her foster carers.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. I have heard the evidence of:</font> </p>

             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE LEGAL POSITION</font></b>
             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The relevant law to be applied is well established. In summary:</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">(A) The burden of proof lies on the Child and Family Agency and the standard of proof is the on the balance of probabilities;</font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(B) The threshold to be established by the Child and Family Agency is set out in section 18 (1) of the 1991 Act;</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(C) The Court must determine whether the threshold has been reached in the case having regard to the evidence adduced and having regard to the rights of the parents whether under the Constitution or otherwise and also the Constitutional rights of children set out in Article 42A and under the 1991 Act;</font></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Even where the threshold for State Intervention has been reached the Court must consider the issue of the proportionality of the Order granted.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. Having heard the evidence set out in this case and the legal submissions of the parties, I conclude on the evidence adduced by the Child and Family Agency that on the balance of probabilities that Child C&#x2019;s health, development and welfare is likely to be avoidably impaired or neglected into the future unless the Court makes an order under this section. I find on the evidence that it is necessary to make the Care Order under section 18 (1) (b) and (c) of the Act of 1991 as amended until the child reaches eighteen years. My reasons for making this order for this duration are as follows;</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) The Order of the Presiding District Court Judge was made for eighteen months to allow the mother to put her life in order. There was nothing in that Order directed towards the father. However, he was aware of the making of the Order and was equally aware that he could also use that period to effect changes to his own lifestyle and relationship with the mother which would enable either or both of them to parent the child;</font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) The father was not certain during his cross examination whether he was still on drugs in 2016. The father&#x2019;s evidence was not clear on this point;</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) Neither parent has engaged in any purposeful way over the last eighteen months to develop a relationship with the Social Worker in this case or with the child through access.</font></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">18. Accordingly, at this time the Court must acknowledge the rights of the child to have her welfare assured though the making of an Order which will provide her with certainty and security by default. Should the father or mother or either or both of them gain traction on their addiction issues and sustain a drug free lifestyle for a sustained period and engage consistently in access and develop a relationship with the child to assure her of their ability and capacity to parent her it is open to them to apply to this court to discharge the Care Order at that time.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. Unfortunately, neither parent is in a position to do so at this time. Accordingly the duration of the Order should be until she reaches eighteen years. I am satisfied this decision is proportionate on the evidence adduced and having regard to the following:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul> 
               <ul>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) the right of the child to have security in her placement;</font> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) the right of the child to have a relationship with her parents and to be able to recognise them;</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) the right of either parent to engage with the Child and Family Agency and seek their support and assistance in all manner necessary to enable them build a relationship with Child C through consistent and sustained access;</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) the right of either parent to demonstrate their capacity to act as Child C&#x2019;s parents. </font></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="
