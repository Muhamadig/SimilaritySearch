             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Brian J. McGovern delivered on the 16th day of February, 2017.</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The first and third named defendants (&#x201c;the defendants&#x201d;) have brought a motion to strike out paras. 50 &#x2013; 61 of the amended statement of claim delivered in these proceedings pursuant to O. 19, r. 27 of the Rules of the Superior Courts and under the inherent jurisdiction of the court. This application is brought on the grounds that the defendants claim that the pleas in paras. 50 &#x2013; 61 disclose no reasonable cause of action and/or are frivolous, vexatious and/or bound to fail.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The plaintiff is the holder of a community trademark (&#x201c;C.T.M.&#x201d;) and claims various declarations, prohibitory injunctions and other relief (including damages) on the basis of an alleged infringement of the plaintiff&#x2019;s intellectual property rights. Although the plenary summons did not set out a claim for breach of competition law pursuant to Article 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union or ss. 4 and 5 of the Competition Act 2002, an amended statement of claim included pleas in respect of those matters. The defendants argue that paras. 50 &#x2013; 61 of the amended statement of claim contain a competition law claim which is indistinguishable from and parasitic upon the C.T.M. infringement claim.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Paragraph 33 of the plaintiff&#x2019;s first reply to particulars dated 16th May, 2016, states that the alleged anti-competitive object of the agreement complained of is &#x201c;&#x2026;to deceptively divert consumers who seek to book flights onto the eDreams website in order to generate revenue both for eDreams and for Google&#x201d;. The defendants argue that the object as pleaded amounts to a plea that the defendants have infringed the protection enjoyed by the plaintiff in its Ryanair Word C.T.M.. If the C.T.M. has not been infringed then it follows that there can be, in law, no infringement of Article 101 or 102 T.F.E.U. or s. 4 or s. 5 of the Act of 2002. If there is an infringement, then that constitutes a breach of the plaintiff&#x2019;s C.T.M. rights and such breach does not in and of itself amount to a breach of competition law or constitute an anti-competitive object. The defendants complain that the competition law claim effectively asserts that the plaintiff is entitled to a greater level of exclusivity than it enjoys under trademark law. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. In summary, the defendants argue that the competition law claim is indistinguishable from the plaintiff&#x2019;s trademark claim in that it goes no further than alleging damage to the plaintiff&#x2019;s interest through the use of its trademark and that it has repackaged a claim for infringement in the guise of a competition law claim. Furthermore, the defendants allege that the competition law claim does not include the fundamental elements of a genuine competition law claim. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. If the court permits the competition law claim to proceed, the defendants apprehend it will give rise to a longer and more expensive trial involving extensive discovery and imposing an unnecessary burden on the defendants. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The plaintiff for its part claims that the competition law claim is a &#x201c;stand-alone claim&#x201d; and that it has particularised its claim sufficiently. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Law on Striking Out Applications</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The jurisdiction on the issue of striking out a claim that is frivolous, vexatious and/or bound to fail is well trodden ground. In this application, the defendants rely on O. 19, r. 27 of the Rules of the Superior Courts and also the inherent jurisdiction of the court. Order 19, r. 27 states:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any matter in any indorsement or pleading which may be unnecessary or scandalous, or which may tend to prejudice, embarrass, or delay the fair trial of the action; and may in any such case, if it shall think fit, order the costs of the application to be paid as between solicitor and client.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">The court has an inherent jurisdiction to strike out or stay proceedings if they are frivolous or vexatious or bound to fail. In </font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1981] I.R. 306 at 308, Costello J. stated that the court has an inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings and is not limited to the pleadings of the parties:-</font>

              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Basically its jurisdiction exists to ensure that an abuse of the process of the Courts does not take place. So, if the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious they will be stayed. They will also be stayed if it is clear that the plaintiff&#x2019;s claim must fail; per Buckley L.J. in </font>

Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2014] IESC 21 at para. 2.2 and 2.3, the Supreme Court approved of the following analysis of Clarke J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Salthill Properties Limited v. Royal Bank of Scotland</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2009] IEHC 207:-</font> </p>

              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;It is true that, in an application to dismiss proceedings as disclosing no cause of action under the provisions of Order 19, the court must accept the facts as asserted in the plaintiff&#x2019;s claim, for if the facts so asserted are such that they would, if true, give rise to a cause of action then the proceedings do disclose a potentially valid claim. However, I would not go so far as to agree with counsel for Salthill and Mr. Cunningham, to the effect that the court cannot engage in some analysis of the facts in an application to dismiss on foot of the inherent jurisdiction of the court. A simple example will suffice. A plaintiff may assert that it entered into a contract with the defendant which contained certain express terms. On examining the document the terms may not be found, or may not be found in the form pleaded. On an application to dismiss as being bound to fail, there is nothing to prevent the defendant producing the contractual documents governing the relations between the parties and attempting to persuade the court that the plaintiff has no chance of establishing that the document concerned could have the meaning contended for because of the absence of the relevant clauses. The whole point of the difference between applications under the inherent jurisdiction of the court, on the one hand, and applications to dismiss on the factual basis of a failure to disclose a cause of action on the other hand is that the court can, in the former, look to some extent at the factual basis of the plaintiff&#x2019;s claim.&#x201d;</font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2000] 3 I.R. 321, Murray J. set out what should be the approach of the court where the plaintiff raises legal issues in response to an application to strike out or dismiss. He said at p. 335:-</font>

              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;It is for the judge hearing the application, within the scope of his discretion, to determine whether any points of law raised can be so clearly and readily resolved in favour of the defendant that to allow the action to proceed would constitute an abuse of the process of the court.

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2006] 1 I.R. 304 at para. 16 Fennelly J. stated that a strike out application is not suitable to cases involving complex issues of law and/or fact. At para. 16 he said:-</font>

             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">12. The burden rests on the defendants to persuade the court that the competition law claim discloses no reasonable cause of action, is frivolous or vexatious or is bound to fail and incapable of being saved by way of amendment to the pleadings or the emergence of any evidence at the trial of the action.</font>

             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Issues</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">13. In these proceedings, Ryanair alleges that Google Ireland and/or Google Inc have a dominant position in what Ryanair describes as the market for internet search and electronic paid internet referencing/advertising services and that they have abused a position of dominance by their refusal to respect and give effect to the Ryanair Word C.T.M. and/or their use and/or exploitation of the Ryanair Word C.T.M. in the AdWords programme and/or that they have entered into an anti-competitive agreement with eDreams. These matters are pleaded in paras. 50 to 61 of the amended statement of claim which the defendants seek to have struck out in this motion. At the hearing of this motion, the court heard lengthy submissions and was referred to three extensive notices for particular and replies thereto wherein these claims were probed further. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. The defendants ask how can competition law be used to extend an exclusive right given by the C.T.M., the effect of which is to exclude competition? They argue that the purpose of a C.T.M. is not to protect its owner against practices inherent in competition and to this end they rely on a decision of the C.J.E.U. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Interflora Inc &amp; Anor v. Marks and Spencer plc &amp; Anor</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Case C-323/09); [2012] Bus. L.R. 1440. In that case, the defendant selected &#x201c;Interflora&#x201d; together with variants of it as a key word for a referencing service operated by a well-known internet search engine. When an internet user entered the word &#x201c;Interflora&#x201d; or one of its variants into the search engine, an advertising link to the defendant&#x2019;s website was generated under the heading &#x201c;sponsored links&#x201d;. The claimants contended that their trademark had been infringed and the High Court in England and Wales referred certain questions to the C.J.E.U. summarised in the headnote to the reported judgment as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;First, whether under Article 5(1)(a) of Council Directive 89/104/EEC and Article 9(1)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 40/94 a trade mark proprietor was entitled to prevent a competitor which sold goods or provided services identical to those covered by the trade mark, from selecting a sign identical to that trade mark as a keyword for an internet referencing service. Secondly, whether by Article 5(2) of the Directive 89/104/EEC and Article 9(1)(c) of Regulation 40/94, the propitiator of a trade mark with a reputation was entitled to prevent a competitor from basing its advertising on a keyword corresponding to the trade mark which the competitor had selected in an internet referencing service. </font>
