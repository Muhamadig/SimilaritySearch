             <ul>
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">12. On 15 July 2015, the Child and Family Agency issued notice of an application for an interim care order pursuant to s. 17(1) of The 1991 Act in respect of F, and also notice of application for a care order pursuant to s. 18(1) of The 1991 Act in respect of F, returnable five further days later, on 20 July 2015. G and D were named as respondents. It appears that those notices were lodged with the court on a date between the 15th and 20th July 2015. The court was seised of these proceedings on a date between the 15th July 2015 and 20th July 2015 and it is immaterial as to which of those dates it was. </font>

              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">13. The s. 17(1) of the The 1991 Act interim care order application was heard on 20 July 2015. The application was refused in circumstances where mother had agreed to "</font>

              </ul> 
              <ul>

              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The application under s. 18(1) of the The 1991 Act which had been issued on 15 July 2015 does not appear to have been opened to the court on 20 July 2015. This is in accordance with the usual practice in this court, where interim care order applications under s. 17(1) of The 1991 Act are generally heard on or shortly after the initial date for which they are issued, while care order applications under s. 18 of The 1991 Act are generally heard some time after the initial date for which they are issued, on fixed hearing dates. </font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">16. It appears that the social workers dealing with the case were of the belief that the refusal of the interim care order application on 20 July 2015 also disposed of the care order application [see paras 30 and 33 of the longer affidavit of Ms D, social worker sworn 10th January 2017]. That belief was in my view mistaken. In any event no order was made on the foot of s. 18 of The 1991 Act application on 20 July 2015, nor was that application referred to in the notice of appeal, or in the order on appeal, and no further application was made to this court by the Child and Family Agency on foot of the s. 18 of The 1991 Act notice of application dated 15 July 2015. I therefore deem the s. 18 of The 1991 Act application dated 15th July 2015 to have been abandoned by the Child and Family Agency at latest on 24</font>

              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">17. The applications in 2015 referred to above, for the emergency care order, interim care order and care order, and the appeal, are hereafter together referred to as the 2015 proceedings.</font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">18. On 29 July 2016 the Child And Family Agency issued notice of an application for an interim care order pursuant to s. 17(1) of The 1991 Act, and also notice of application for a care order pursuant to s.18(1) of The 1991 Act, for hearing on 9th August 2016. G and D were named as respondents. </font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">19. In respect of the said proceedings under The 1991 Act of which notices were issued on 29 July 2016, it appears that those notices were lodged with the court on a date between the 29th July 2016 and 9th August 2016 (Ms D social worker in her longer affidavit dated 10th January 2017 at paragraph 36 avers that the notices were lodged on 2nd August 2016). The court was seised of these proceedings on a date between the 29th July 2016 and 9th August 2016 and it is immaterial as to which of those dates it was.</font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">20. On 9 August 2016, this court heard the application for an interim care order pursuant to s. 17(1) of The 1991 Act, which was granted, to 6 September 2016. F has remained in the care of the Child and Family Agency since 9 August 2016 under the initial interim care order granted and under a series of extensions of the interim care order, the latest extension granted on 7 February 2017 to expire on 8 March 2017. </font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">21. The application pursuant to s. 18(1) of The 1991 Act, which was issued on 29 July 2016, has not been opened to the court nor has a hearing date for it been sought or fixed. That application presently stands adjourned to 8 March 2017.</font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">22. On 4 October 2016, on an application for extension of the interim care order, the court noted that its jurisdiction should be determined. This was clearly a reference to determination of jurisdiction in accordance with The Regulation.</font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">23. On 1 November 2016, on an application for extension of the interim care order, the issue of jurisdiction was again raised. It appears that discussion may have centred on the possibility of transfer of the case to The Member State under Art. 15 of The Regulation. No determination was made under The Regulation on that date.</font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">24. On 29 November 2016, on an application for extension of the interim care order, the court referred to The Regulation, and fixed 15 December 2016 for hearing of the necessary inquiry.</font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">25. On 15 December 2016, the matter of the inquiry pursuant to The Regulation came before me for hearing. It was clear that the affidavit filed by the Child and Family Agency was in contemplation of an application under Article 15 of The Regulation. G said that she was expecting (correctly) on that day to deal with an enquiry regarding jurisdiction. I was not satisfied that B was on notice of the jurisdiction inquiry, or any other inquiry that might follow under The Regulation. I adjourned to 6 January 2017, to allow for filing an affidavit evidence relating to habitual residence issues, and for notice to be given to B.</font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">26. On 6 January 2017, I part heard the inquiry regarding jurisdiction under The Regulation. Reserving the right of B to make submissions, I heard the parties present and the guardian </font>

              <font size="2" face="Verdana"> on the issue of the date on which this court was seized under article 16 of The Regulation. I ultimately adjourned, part heard, to 13 January 2017.</font>

              <font size="2" face="Verdana">27. On 13 January 2017, and again on 1 February 2017, and again on 7 February 2017 I further adjourned the jurisdiction inquiry in effect to facilitate B who had indicated positively to the Child and Family Agency solicitor that he was in the process of instructing solicitors. I required the Child and Family Agency solicitor to notify B that the matter would proceed on 14 February 2017. I formally joined B as a party to the proceedings for the purpose of The Regulation enquiries and for the purpose of dealing with paternity.</font>

              <font size="2" face="Verdana">28. On 14 February 2017, having allowed what I consider to be adequate opportunity for B or his lawyers to attend, I proceeded to decision on the issue regarding seizing of the court for the purposes of Article 16 of The Regulation.</font>

              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">29. I had previously heard submissions in this regard, including submissions that the seizing of the court of the 2015 proceedings, in July 2015, was rendered continuous by virtue of the Child and Family Agency taking protective measures in respect of F (i.e. "</font>

              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">30. I have considered all of the submissions made. I do not find that the continuance of protective measures (i.e. "</font>

The court was seized of the 2015 proceedings from 13 July 2015 or thereabouts, to at the very latest 24 November 2015. The court should have examined jurisdiction in 2015, but it did not. The court became seized again on 29 July 2016 of a new set of proceedings. The court took up examination of jurisdiction per The Regulation in the context of the 2016 proceedings. I hold that examination as to jurisdiction now should refer to the date on which the court was seised of the 2016 proceedings. The court was seised of the 2016 proceedings on a date between the 29th July 2016 and 9th August 2016 (hereinafter "the relevant date").

              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">38. G has a child with D, namely R (born xxxx 2014). R was the subject of child protection proceedings in The Member State and was made the subject of a care order, apparently on 6 February 2015.</font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">39. G arrived in Ireland at the end of March 2015. </font>

              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">40. G says that she came to Ireland to escape from an alleged abusive relationship with D. She says that despite the relationship ending in 2014 there continued to be some contact (she implied a controlling relationship) prior to her leaving The Member State.</font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">41. G was approximately 24 weeks pregnant when she arrived in Ireland. She says that she did not know that she was pregnant at that time, but she felt sick when travelling to Ireland and that subsequent to her arrival she realised she was pregnant. In evidence she said that when she was pregnant with R she had known she was pregnant within weeks. In evidence she said she was aware that R had been received into care and that it was likely that there would be an application to take any child subsequently born to her into care.</font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">42. G travelled to Ireland with one week's clothing and &#x20ac;150. She says (at paragraph 10 of her affidavit) that her trip to Ireland was initially intended "</font>

              <font size="2" face="Verdana">" and was "</font>

              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">43. I do not accept G's evidence regarding her reasons for travelling to Ireland. I hold on the balance of probabilities that she was aware of her pregnancy prior to her departure from the Member State and that the primary reason for her travelling to Ireland was to avoid the attention of The Member State&#x2019;s child protection authorities.</font>
              <br> 
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">44. In her affidavit, G states that in the 6 - 9 months prior to her travelling to this jurisdiction, she resided full time with her parents. Since her arrival in Ireland, G has stayed in hostel accommodation. She has also stated that prior to the relevant date she applied for local authority housing in Ireland. At the relevant date she had not been allocated housing. </font>

              <br>

              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">46. Following her arrival in Ireland, G applied for social welfare payments. Her claim dated 20th of April 2015 was refused, on appeal, on "</font>

Her affidavit, at paragraph 20, implies that an appeal was allowed, but her affidavit exhibits a letter of 14 July 2015, the exhibited letter states the opposite. Nevertheless, her affidavit also exhibits social welfare payment slips for various dates throughout 2015. Her affidavit also states that whatever difficulty there was initially with social welfare payments had been resolved by August 2015 and that she has been in payment since, which is not disputed.</font>
