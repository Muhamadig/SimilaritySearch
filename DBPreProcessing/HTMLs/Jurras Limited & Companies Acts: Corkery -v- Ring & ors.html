             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Ms. Justice Stewart delivered on the 31st day of March, 2017.</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This is a decision on foot of the defendants&#x2019; motion seeking leave pursuant to O. 25, r. 2 of the Rules of the Superior Courts directing trial of a preliminary issue, namely the issue of the petitioner&#x2019;s </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">locus standi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to bring his petition.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. This matter commenced by way of a petition brought before the High Court on 10th June, 2015, together with the notice of motion seeking directions with regard to the proceedings to be taken on foot of the petition herein. Preliminary directions were made by consent of the parties on 12th October, 2015. Thereafter, points of claim were delivered on 2nd December, 2015, and points of defence were delivered on the 8th February, 2016. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The respondents pleaded as a preliminary issue in the points of defence that the petitioner does not have </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">locus standi</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to bring the within petition, as he is not a member of the company. A notice seeking voluntary discovery dated 25th February, 2016, was furnished by the petitioner&#x2019;s solicitors and was followed up by a motion seeking voluntary discovery on 4th April, 2016. This resulted in an affidavit of discovery being sworn by Adrian Hegarty, a solicitor for the respondents, on 3rd May, 2016. The respondents&#x2019; solicitors sent a request for voluntary discovery on 7th March, 2016, which resulted in an affidavit of discovery being sworn by the petitioner herein on 4th April, 2016. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. On 14th June, 2016, the respondents issued a notice of motion seeking trial on the following preliminary issue: </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;1. An Order pursuant to Order 25 rule 2 directing the trial of a preliminary issue of law, namely, the preliminary issue raised in the points of defence of the said Respondents that the Petitioner does not have locus standi to bring his Petition.</font></i> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. An Order staying the operation of the amended consent order for directions made by the Honourable Court on 25th January, 2016 pending the determination of the within motion.&#x201d; </font></i></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The notice of motion seeking leave for a trial of a preliminary issue was grounded on the affidavit of Adrian Hegarty, solicitor for the respondent, which was sworn on the 13th June, 2016. There was a replying affidavit sworn by John P. Cahill, the solicitor for the petitioner, on 28th June, 2016. A further affidavit of discovery was sworn by Adrian Hegarty on 15th July, 2016. A supplemental replying affidavit of John P. Cahill was sworn on 13th July, 2016. A second affidavit of Adrian Hegarty was sworn on 18th July. 2016. A third affidavit of Adrian Hegarty was sworn on 18th July, 2016. A second supplemental affidavit of John P. Cahill was sworn on 14th September, 2016. A notice of motion, dated 13th October, 2016, was brought by the petitioner in respect of further &amp; better discovery, which was grounded on the affidavit of John P. Cahill sworn on 10th October, 2016. Adrian Hegarty swore a relpying affidavit thereto on 12th December, 2016.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The petitioner was employed by the respondent, initially as a general operative and then later as a window salesman. It appears that, in or around 2004, he was allocated a shareholding in Jurras Limited, the respondent company. There seems to be a dispute as to whether the initial holding comprised of 80 ordinary shares or 53 E-Ordinary shares. The petitioner&#x2019;s employment with the respondents terminated on 25th September, 2014. This occurred following a mutual agreement between the petitioner and his employers which is confidential and has not been disclosed to this Court. The parties appear to agree that the confidential agreement was silent as to the question of the petitioner&#x2019;s extant shareholding in the company at the time his employment was terminated.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The respondents maintain that, at the time of his employment, the petitioner held 35 e-Ordinary shares in the company. The respondents rely on Clause 2A of the company&#x2019;s amended Articles of Association, which provide that an E-Ordinary shareholder does not have the right to receive notice, attend, speak or vote at any general meetings of the company. Further, the respondents rely on the provisions of Article 4, which provides as follows:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;E Ordinary Shares may only be held by an individual who is in the employment of a company which is a subsidiary of Gairdini. Any E Ordinary Shareholder whose employment is terminated for whatever reason shall agree to have their shares converted into redeemable E Ordinary Shares and the provisions relating to the redemption as specified in Article 4A hereof shall apply or to transfer the shares to a person nominated by the directors of the company and shall complete whatever documentation necessary to give effect to the either the redemption or transfer as appropriate. The price to be paid on the E Ordinary Share(s) shall be determined as if the company was to be wound up&#x2026;&#x201d;</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">8. Article 4A of the Articles of Association provides that: </font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;In accordance with Article 4 the shares of a departing E Ordinary Shareholder or a deceased E Ordinary Shareholder shall be classified as redeemable as long as the number of the shares redeemable shall not exceed 90% of the issued share capital.</font></i> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) Redemption of the whole or any part of the redeemable E Ordinary Shares for the time being issued and outstanding shall be at the discretion of the Company; howsoever, that a decision of the Company regarding such redemption shall be by Ordinary Resolution passed at a duly convened General Meeting of the shareholders entitled to receive notice of, attend and vote at General Meetings, or Resolution of the shareholders entitled to vote on such resolutions. </font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) There shall be paid on each redeemable E Ordinary Share redeemed, the amount which would be paid if the company was to be wound up. </font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) When any redeemable E Ordinary Shares are being redeemed by the Company, the Company shall give 7 clear days notice of such redemption to the holder (s) of the relevant shares to be redeemed.&#x201d;</font></i></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">9. The respondents maintain that a person who is not a member of a company or who is not currently a member of a company cannot petition for relief pursuant to s. 212 of the Act of 2014. The respondents rely on </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Re Via Net works (Ireland) Limited</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2002] 2 I.R. 47, in which the Supreme Court held that persons who had agreed to transfer their shareholding pursuant to a shareholder&#x2019;s agreement did not have </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">locus standi</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> in their action against the company, notwithstanding that their names were still present on the Register as shareholders. Keane C.J. explained the remedy in the following terms:</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Persons, such as the petitioners, who have voluntarily disposed of their entire shareholding in a company could not conceivably have been contemplated by the legislature as persons who would be entitled to relief under s. 205. Nor is it any answer to say that, because the petitioners have not transferred their shares, as they are contractually bound to do, they remain registered as members of the company. It is undoubtedly the case that a person who has become entitled to be registered as a shareholder may be unable to exercise any of his rights as a shareholder until his name has been entered on the register. But it does not follow that a person who, conversely, has voluntarily divested himself of all his shares in the company, but remains on the register must be treated as a member of the company for all purposes. I have no doubt that, when the legislature enacted s. 205(1) [the predecessor of section 212], it was not envisaged that persons without any interest in the company but who, for whatever reason, remained on the register as members would be entitled to present a petition grounded on alleged oppression of them as members.&#x201d;</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. In assessing the suitability of a trial on the question of </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">locus standi</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> as a preliminary issue, the petitioner stated in the oral and written submissions that the main issue in dispute is the payment of monies that he is rightfully due as a shareholder. In seeking to have a preliminary issue tried, the respondents allege that two facts have been established: (a) - the employment was terminated on 25th September 2014, and (b) - The resolution to redeem the petitioner&#x2019;s shares is valid. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. Further, the petitioner states that the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Via Net Works</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> case is not relevant because the mechanism that went about divesting the petitioners of their shares was a shareholders&#x2019; agreement and not the Articles of Association (which allegedly fill that role in the case currently before the Court). Even if the court were to adopt the view that a shareholders&#x2019; agreement could be equated with the Articles of Association, the petitioner maintains that there was no triggering event giving rise to the redemption of the shares. This is asserted as the Articles of Association do not provide for a self-executing alienation of the shares on the termination of employment. The petitioner alleges that the triggering event envisaged by the Articles of Association never occurred. The respondents argue that a triggering event did occur. According to the petitioner, this dispute puts to rest any question of O. 25 procedures being invoked and this matter should therefore proceed to a unitary hearing.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. The petitioner also submits that Article 4C mandates a seven day notice period between the conversion of shares and the passage of a resolution to redeem. The petitioner maintains that no such notice was served on him and no admissions/concessions are made in this regard. The petitioner also raises issues in relation to the purported value of the redeemed shares at par of &#x20ac;1, notwithstanding that the Articles of Association refer to higher share value. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. Finally, the petitioner complains that the application for the trial of a preliminary issue is out of time, in that it should have been sought at the hearing for directions on 12th October, 2015. The respondents assert in reply that any alleged delay in bringing the O. 25 application accrues from 8th February, 2016, when pleadings were closed. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. The respondents also submit that the petitioner&#x2019;s attempt to dispute the special resolution that redeemed his shareholding is merely a formal traverse. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decision</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. I do not accept that characterisation of this dispute as a formal traverse would be a correct approach for the Court to adopt. The petitioner has raised serious issues in his points of claim and in his affidavits. The petitioner specifically put in issue every matter raised by the respondent and has put the respondent on full proof of all matters pertaining to his shareholding.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Both parties seem to agree that cessation of employment occurred within the meaning of Article 4A. However, the petitioner submits that Article 4A is only triggered when the shares in question are properly converted. The petitioner further points out that he should have been called upon by the company to transfer or convert his shares. In the event that he refused to so do, it was allegedly open to the company to seek specific performance under the Articles of Association. There is no record of a transfer or conversion taking place regarding his shares. The respondents purport to rely on a resolution of the company dated 5th October, 2014, redeeming the petitioner&#x2019;s shares. However, there is no evidence before the Court of a resolution of the company referring to the transfer/conversion of the shares, nor is there any document calling upon the petitioner to transfer or convert the shares. The petitioner is entitled to put the respondent on full proof of matters which are at issue in the proceedings. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. Both sides acknowledge the question of terminating the shareholding was not addressed in the agreement terminating employment. Perhaps it should have been. But it wasn&#x2019;t and I am of the view that the question of whether or not the petitioner was a shareholder on the date the petition was issued is a live issue in the case. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. With regard to the allegations of delay, the principles outlined by McKechnie J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Campion v. South Tipperary County Council</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] IESC 79 are relevant and are as follows:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;35. The following therefore is a summary of the legal position before Order 25 of the RSC can be successfully invoked:-</font></i> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2022; There cannot exist any dispute about the material facts as asserted by the relevant party: such can be agreed by the moving party or accepted by him or her, solely for the purposes of the application.</font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2022; There must exist a question of law which is discreet and which can be distilled from the factual matrix as presented.</font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2022; There must result from such a process a saving of time and cost, when the same is contrasted with any other suggested method by which the issues may be disposed of: in default with a unitary trial of the entire action. In the absence of admissions, appropriate evidence will usually be necessary in this regard: impressions of what might or might not be, will not be sufficient.</font></i> </p>
