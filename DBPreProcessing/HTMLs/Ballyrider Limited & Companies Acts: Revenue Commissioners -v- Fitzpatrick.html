             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT delivered by Ms. Justice Finlay Geoghegan on the 7th day of April 2017 </font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This judgment is supplemental to a judgment delivered by this Court (Irvine J.: Finlay Geoghegan J. and Hogan J. concurring) on 26th July, 2016; [2016] IECA 228. That judgment concerned the substantive issues in dispute in relation to orders made by the High Court on 25th July, 2015 and 30th July, 2015, removing the appellant (&#x201c;Mr. Fitzpatrick&#x201d;) as liquidator of Ballyrider Limited (&#x201c;the Company&#x201d;), appointing Mr. Maloney as liquidator in his place, and directing Mr. Fitzpatrick to hand over to Mr. Maloney books, records, and sums retained in the liquidation, along with other sums in respect of monies already paid out of the liquidation by Mr. Fitzpatrick, or retained on account of his fees. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. In the first judgment, this Court dismissed the appeal against the removal of Mr. Fitzpatrick as liquidator pursuant to s. 227 of the Companies Act 1963 and the consequential appointment of Mr. Maloney, but allowed the appeal against the consequential orders to pay over monies no longer retained in the liquidation. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. There were in fact three separate appeals brought by Mr. Fitzpatrick to this Court. This arose by reason of orders made by the High Court on different dates. The costs order of the High Court, for the reasons set out in a judgment delivered by Murphy J. on 27th October, 2015, was not formally made until 29th April, 2016. The appeal on costs was left over until after the delivery of judgment in the two substantive appeals. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The parties were permitted to put in further submissions and there was a further short oral hearing on 24th March, 2017 in relation to both the appeal on costs and also the costs of the appeals themselves. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The order made in the High Court on costs was:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) That neither the costs of the Revenue Commissioners nor Mr. Fitzpatrick are costs properly incurred in the liquidation. </font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) That Mr. Fitzpatrick personally pay to the Revenue Commissioners the costs of the proceedings when taxed or ascertained. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) A stay on the order for costs pending the outcome of the appeal. </font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The High Court proceedings were commenced by an originating notice of motion dated 19th August, 2014 seeking orders pursuant to s. 280 of the Companies Act 1963 (&#x201c;the 1963 Act&#x201d;) directing Mr. Fitzpatrick to refrain from bringing certain proceedings in the name and on behalf of the Company, and also declaring that certain costs, charges, and expenses were not properly incurred and could not be paid out of the assets of the Company in priority to other claims. It also sought, in the alternative, an order pursuant to s. 277 of the 1963 Act removing Mr. Fitzpatrick as liquidator of the Company. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The Company is in voluntary liquidation. The Revenue Commissioners are a preferential creditor and have a nominee as a member of the Committee of Inspection. The application was brought against Mr. Fitzpatrick in his capacity as liquidator of the Company in voluntary liquidation. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. The trial judge, in delivering judgment on costs on 27th October 2015, concluded that the Revenue Commissioners had been successful in their application and that in accordance with the general rule under O. 99 of the Rules of the Superior Courts, costs should follow the event. She further held that the order should be made against Mr. Fitzpatrick personally, and that neither his costs nor those of the Revenue Commissioners were costs properly incurred in the liquidation. Her reason for this conclusion was that in the application Mr. Fitzpatrick was solely protecting his own interests; it was his conduct in the liquidation which was in issue and found to be deficient and in those circumstances he could not be characterised as acting as agent of the Company such as would render the Company liable to defray his costs. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. At the costs appeal hearing, counsel for Mr. Fitzpatrick clarified that he was not pursuing an appeal against the determination that his costs of resisting the High Court application or any order for costs against him in either court could be treated as costs in the liquidation in respect of which he would be entitled to an indemnity out of the assets of the Company. That was a wise decision on the facts herein and the decision of the High Court. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The submissions made by counsel on behalf of Mr. Fitzpatrick may be summarised under three broad headings. First, as a matter of principle, this application is not one in which a court should, pursuant to O. 99, r. 1 make an order against Mr. Fitzpatrick, as a liquidator, personally. If the court did not accede to that submission then there were special circumstances in relation to the assertion and absence of any finding that Mr. Fitzpatrick had acted negligently as liquidator. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. Second, he submitted that the trial judge had failed to take account in her costs determination of what she had stated at para. 85 of her substantive judgment. There she stated:&#x2014;</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Finally, the Court observes that had the applicant exercised its rights as a member of the Committee of Inspection more vigorously from the outset some if not all of the difficulties encountered in this liquidation might have been avoided.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Third, in part as an alternative submission, even on the determinations of the High Court it was submitted that the primary reliefs sought were directions pursuant to s. 280 of the 1963 Act which were founded on a claim of negligence, and there was no determination that Mr. Fitzpatrick had been negligent. In those circumstances he submitted that the trial judge ought to have determined, in accordance with the principles set out in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Veolia Water (UK) &amp; Ors. v. Fingal Co. Co. (No.2) </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">[2007] 2 I.R. 81 (and any subsequent judgments), that each party had been successful on certain issues and therefore that there ought to have been a reduction or total set off of the costs. In addition, he submitted that following the first judgment of this Court, it was now the position that Mr. Fitzpatrick had succeeded in resisting the consequential orders in dispute and that in accordance with the </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Veolia</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> principles there should now be no order as between the parties in respect of the High Court costs. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. On the costs of the appeal, his submission was that there should be no order as to costs as whilst the Revenue Commissioners had succeeded on the appeal in relation to the removal of Mr. Fitzpatrick as liquidator, the latter had succeeded on the appeal against the consequential orders. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. Counsel for the Revenue Commissioners, in summary, submitted that the trial judge correctly determined that this was an application to which the normal rule that costs follow the event should apply, the comment at para. 85 of her judgment did not warrant any diminution, and that following the decision of this Court there should only be a very small deduction from the overall costs. Similarly, in relation to the appeal, it was submitted that the principal issue was the removal of Mr. Fitzpatrick, and that there should be separate orders on the different appeals or only a small deduction from a full order for costs in favour of the Revenue Commissioners. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Discussion and decision</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The application brought by the Revenue Commissioners on an originating notice of motion is a &#x201c;proceeding in the Superior Courts&#x201d; such that in accordance with O. 99, r. 1, the costs of the application is within the discretion of the Court. Neither party submitted that O. 99, r. 1(4) did not apply as such. This sub-rule provides that, subject to sub-rule (4A) (interlocutory applications); </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The costs of every issue of fact or law raised upon a claim or counterclaim shall, unless otherwise ordered, follow the event.&#x201d; </font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">The motion grounded on affidavit by the Revenue Commissioners is the claim for the purposes of this rule. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. I cannot accept the submission made by counsel on behalf of Mr. Fitzpatrick that as a matter of principle, in a successful application to remove a liquidator pursuant to s. 277, the starting point for a consideration of the exercise by the Court of its discretion is other than that costs follow the event, i.e., that the applicant is entitled to an order against the liquidator personally. Mr. Hayden S.C. submitted that if this was the approach taken by the Court, then a liquidator faced with such an application is confronted with an impossible or unfair choice, namely, does he immediately accede to the application (or possibly resign) even though in his view the application is unwarranted, or does he decide to resist the application, and risk an order for costs being made against him. I recognise that that is a decision which a liquidator faced with such an application must take. Nevertheless, it is a decision which many defendants or respondents to applications before our courts must also take. It follows from the general approach to costs in our court system. It does not appear to me that there is any basis for exempting a liquidator faced with such an application from having to take the appropriate decision. A liquidator who accepts an appointment in a voluntary liquidation does so subject to the relevant legislation in force which at the time included s.277 of the 1963 Act. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. On the facts of this application, the trial judge was entitled to determine that the liquidator in resisting the application was acting in his own interest. It was perhaps understandable given the basis upon which the application was brought that Mr. Fitzpatrick should seek to justify what he had done and resist the application that he be removed. He clearly wished to defend his professional reputation as a liquidator. Nevertheless, he was unsuccessful in resisting the application for his removal both in the High Court and again on appeal. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. Neither do I consider that the fact that there was no finding of negligence, misconduct, personal unfitness or lack of integrity on the part of the liquidator means that costs should not follow the event. For the reasons set out by the trial judge, and upheld in the first judgment of this Court, a conclusion that the liquidator had not conducted the liquidation in an efficient and cost effective manner provides good grounds for removal pursuant to s. 277 of the 1963 Act. That was the primary basis upon which the order was made by the High Court and upheld by this Court. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. The submissions on behalf of Mr. Fitzpatrick sought to rely by analogy upon the approach to the orders for costs in proceedings brought against a liquidator when he is acting as agent for the company and seeking to defend the assets of the company. The Court was referred to the discussion by Oliver J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Re Wilson Lovatt &amp; Sons Limited</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1977] 1 All E.R. 274. The Court was also referred to a judgment given by me in the High Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Re Visual Impact and Displays Limited (in liquidation) Murphy v. Murphy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2003] 4 I.R. 451. As identified at p. 457 in that judgment, the general rule in such litigation is that the costs of a successful plaintiff or applicant are paid out of the assets of the company, although &#x201c;under exceptional circumstances an order may be made going beyond that and giving them the right to be paid by the liquidator personally&#x201d;. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. However, that line of authority does not appear to me apposite to an application such as the present where a creditor seeks to remove a liquidator pursuant to s. 277 of the 1963 Act. As was the position in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Murphy v. Murphy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (which related to an application under s. 150 of the Companies Act 1990), it is the liquidator personally, as distinct from the company in liquidation being sued through the agency of the liquidator, who is the party to this application. The issue here was whether or not the liquidator should remain in office. The application did not concern any dispute between the Revenue Commissioners and the company in liquidation. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21. The fact that the starting point is that costs should follow the event does not, of course, preclude the Court from considering all the relevant circumstances of the application, including the basis of the application as made and upon which it succeeded. The Court must also consider whether there were other issues raised in the application upon which the Revenue Commissioners were not successful. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22. The remaining question is whether Mr. Fitzpatrick, as the appellant, has established a basis upon which this Court should interfere with the order for costs made in the High Court. In a judgment delivered by me (with which my colleagues concurred) on 25th March, 2017 in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sony Music Entertainment (Ireland) Limited v. UPC Communications Ireland Limited</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2017] IECA 96 I considered the appellate jurisdiction in an appeal against a discretionary order for costs pursuant to O. 99 of the Rules of the Superior Courts in the context of the earlier judgment of Irvine J. in this Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Collins v.
