             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Ms. Justice Stewart delivered on 24th day of March, 2017.</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The application currently before the Court involves a motion for a certificate for leave to appeal this Court’s decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">E.K.K. (Democratic Rep. of Congo) v. Minister for Justice &amp; Equality and Ors </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2016] IEHC 38. The background facts and the decision of the Court are set out therein. In that case, the Court refused the application for an order of certiorari in respect of a decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to affirm the decision of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which denied the applicant refugee status. The Court’s reasoning revolved around the principles outlined by Peart J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Imafu v. MJELR</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2005] IEHC 182 and procedural failures on the applicant’s part regarding her grounding affidavit. The </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Imafu </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">principles state that a fundamental lack of credibility on the applicant’s part absolves the decision-maker of the requirement to consider country-of-origin information when determining the veracity of the applicant’s story. The procedural issue in question relates to the failure to comply with O. 40, R.13A, 14 &amp; 14A of the Rule of the Superior Courts (Affidavits) 2012 (hereon referred to as “the ROSC”) when swearing the affidavit of a deponent who does not possess sufficient fluency in an official language of the State. The applicant now seeks a certificate for leave to appeal, pursuant to s. 5(6)(a) of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 (as amended by s. 74 of the Court of Appeal Act 2014). S. 5 states that the High Court shall only grant a certificate where its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and it is desirable in the public interest that an appeal be taken to the Court of Appeal.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Applicant’s submissions</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Paul O’Shea B.L., for the applicant, relies on the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R.A. v Refugee Appeals Tribunal &amp; Ors No. 2 </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2015] IEHC 830, in which Humphreys J. granted a certificate for a similar question regarding the</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Imafu </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">principles. Humphreys J concluded that the differing approaches to the application of those principles outlined by Eagar J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.M.S. v Minister for Justice &amp; Equality</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] IEHC 659 and, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, his own decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R.A. v. Refugee Appeals Tribunal No. 1</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] IEHC 686 constituted a point of law of exceptional public importance. At para. 9, he stated: </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“The essential point remains that the resolution by the Court of Appeal of a conflict between two High Court judgments is classically a potential point of law of exceptional public importance particularly where there is a huge and inevitable potential for the same issues to be raised time and again in future High Court cases.”</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The applicant also challenges Humphreys J.’s finding in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R.A. No. 2</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> that a pending appeal before the Court of Appeal militates against a second certification of the same question. She contends that, should the </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R.A.</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> case be withdrawn from the Court of Appeal for whatever reason, she is left without an answer to her question. The applicant employs similar reasoning against an adjournment of these proceedings until the R.A. case has been decided by the Court of Appeal. She also submits that the adjournment of similar cases is a matter for the Court of Appeal and that the questions over the interpretation of EU law raised in this case mandate the grant a certificate, per Cooke J.’s decision in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lofinmakin (an infant) v. Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform and Ors </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">[2011] IEHC 116. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. Regarding the applicant’s procedural failings, the applicant submits that O. 14, R. 13A, 14 and 14A ROSC should have been dis-applied in the applicant’s case in order to prevent the contravention of EU law, particularly Art. 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. A similar argument is made regarding any attempt to rely on the common law predecessor to R. 14, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saleem v. Minister for Justice</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2011] IEHC 49. It is also submitted that this Court’s decision is in conflict with Hogan J.’s approach to the dismissal of proceedings for procedural non-compliance, as outlined in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">S.A. v. Refugee Appeals Tribunal</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2012] IEHC 8. Thus, it is alleged that a point of law of exceptional public importance exists under Humphreys J.’s reasoning in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R.A. No. 2</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. Regardless of Humphreys J.’s approach in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R.A. No. 2</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the applicant submits that the questions raised by the application of the Imafu principles and the circumstances in which judicial review proceedings can be dismissed for procedural non-compliance meet the criteria for the grant of a certificate, as outlined in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Glancr� Teoranta v. An Bord Plean�la</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2006] IEHC 250 and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Arklow Holidays Ltd v.

             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Respondents’ Submissions</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. Anthony Moore B.L., for the respondents, submits that Humphreys J. gave too much weight to Eagar J.’s decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.M.S.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and argues that a point of law of exceptional public importance does not necessarily arise because one division of the High Court diverges from an established consensus of case law. They rely on Herbert J.’s decision in</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> J.I. v. Refugee Appeals Tribunal </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2008] IEHC 395, in which he states:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> “An uncertainty with regard to the application or not of a particular rule of law in different factual situations is not necessarily a matter of, "exceptional public importance". In my judgment, to meet that criterion the point of law involved would have to be a frequently recurring one, determinative of important rights or obligations of the public generally, or of a particular clearly identifiable and numerous section of the public.”</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">The respondents submit that there is no evidence to suggest that Eagar J.’s approach in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.M.S.</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> has been proliferated outside the facts of that case and that this undermines its status as a point of law of exceptional public importance. They rely on Hanna J.’s judgment in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ugbo v. Minister for Justice </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">[2010] IEHC 355, in which he concluded that the law must be in such a state of uncertainty that it is in the common good to see the law clarified. It is submitted that the application of the </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Imafu</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> principles does not meet that standard.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. Regarding the procedural matters outlined in O. 40, R. 13A, 14 &amp; 14A ROSC, the respondents contest the application of EU law to this issue, per Art. 52 &amp; 53 of the Charter. Regardless, they submit that, far from obstructing the application of Art. 47, the impugned rules actually facilitate it by ensuring that the material placed before the Court by the deponent is as it was intended. They also submit that the rules are proportionate, are as unrestrictive as possible, satisfy the principles of equivalence &amp; effectiveness and pursue a legitimate aim. Thus, they allegedly satisfy the requirements set out in the CJEU caselaw (see, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia, Commission v. Germany </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">C-490/04). The respondents submit that the above arguments, along with the legitimate public interest served by the impugned rules, undermine any suggestion that a point of law of exceptional public importance exists under this heading.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. It is also submitted that the applicant’s solicitors were contacted by the respondents in advance of the proceedings to express concern over the failure to comply with R. 13A, 14 &amp; 14A, but they did not receive a satisfactory response.</font><br> </p>

Having heard the parties’ arguments relating to the procedural flaws in the applicant’s grounding affidavit, the Court is concerned that the applicant has failed to appreciate the consequences of her conduct in this regard. The respondents have submitted, in the oral and written submissions for both hearings, that they were aware of the flaws in the applicant’s affidavit prior to the first hearing. They submitted that
