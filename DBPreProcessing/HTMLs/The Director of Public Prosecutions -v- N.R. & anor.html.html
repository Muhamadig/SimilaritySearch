             <br> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Application to amend the indictment </font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions applied to add a number of new charges to the indictment:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">a. A charge of threat to kill. Counsel stated that there were actually three threats to kill and referred to DVD 1 and DVD 2. She stated there were at least two charges of threat to kill and also in respect of the threat to throw him out the window, a threat to cause serious injury.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">b. She requested the court in respect of the child giving evidence of being filmed by his father, that s. 5 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 could be added to the indictment on the basis that the child had given evidence of being filmed by his father having been coerced to have sex with his mother in the family sitting room. She said that the child was engaged in explicit sexual activity.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">c. She also requested counts to be added to the indictment in respect of the child’s evidence that his father had inserted a camera into the keyhole which he said flashed like morse code. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">d. She also requested the court to add to the indictment a count of wilful assault in respect of the second incident of being locked in the box. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">e. She also sought further counts in respect of sexual assault in respect of the poker inserted into the child’s anus. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">f. She also sought further charges of assault in respect of his father kicking him and tripping him over which is contained on DVD 1. </font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">2. In respect of R.N., she requested that the court add to the indictment counts of sexual assault and sexual exploitation. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. She quoted s. 6 of the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act 1924: </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">“Where, before trial, or at any stage of a trial, it appears to the court that the indictment is defective, the court shall make such order for the amendment of the indictment as the court thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case, unless the required amendments cannot in the opinion of the court be made without injustice.”</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The two authorities cited by the prosecution related to </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R. v. Dossi</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1919] 13 Cr.App.R. 158 where the amendment amounted to the substitution of relevant dates. In the case of </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Director of Public Prosecutions v. Raymond Walsh</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2010] 4 I.R. 746 the trial judge had amended the indictment by the substitution of four counts where the Director of Public Prosecutions had prosecuted the defendants on fourteen counts. Again the amendments in this case related to the substitution of certain dates. In that case, Fennelly J. stated:</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“The purpose of any amendment must be to ensure that the jury will address the true issues when it comes to deliberate on their verdict. The counts in the indictment should correspond as closely as reasonably possible with a real case for the prosecution. A court should not exercise the power in circumstances involving prejudice to the defendant in the defence of the charges against him.”</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">5. However this Court is of the view that the Director of Public Prosecutions having received three statements of the complainant and the two DVDs of evidence could have proffered these charges which are now sought by counsel for the prosecution. Clearly counsel for the prosecution was not consulted prior to the preparation of the indictment but it is not the court’s function to act as a substitute for the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to counts in the indictment nor is it the court’s function to act as substitute for the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to adding counts to the indictment. What is sought is very substantial. Nevertheless, it all arises from the particular evidence of the witness which is contained in the statements of evidence and the DVD interviews. In these circumstances the court is declining to add any of the proposed charges to the indictment in particular having regard to the accused’s right to a fair trial and not a trial by ambush. </font>

             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Application for a direction</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The judicial power to direct an acquittal in appropriate circumstances is well established. Principles governing directions to acquit were set out by the English Court of Appeal in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R. v. Galbraith </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[1981] 1 W.L.R. 1039. They have consistently been followed in Ireland and were stated by Lord Lane in the following terms:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“(1) If there is no evidence that the crime alleged has been committed by the defendant, there is no difficulty. The judge will of course stop the case. (2) The difficulty arises where there is some evidence but it is of a tenuous character, for example because of inherent weakness or vagueness or because it is inconsistent with other evidence. (a) Where the judge comes to the conclusion that the prosecution evidence, taken at its highest, is such that a jury properly directed could not properly convict upon it, it is his duty, upon a submission being made, to stop the case. (b) Where however the prosecution evidence is such that its strength or weakness depends on the view to be taken of a witness's reliability, or other matters which are generally speaking within the province of the jury and where on one possible view of the facts there is evidence upon which a jury could properly come to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty, then the judge should allow the matter to be tried by the jury.”</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">In The Director of Public Prosecutions v. Lacey (unreported, the Court of Criminal Appeal, 3rd July, 2002), the court noted these principles with approval.</font>
             <br> 
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sexual exploitation charges against N.R. and R.N.</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The prosecution seeks to lay the following acts as sexual exploitation:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">i. Forcing the child to watch pornography.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ii. Filming the child in the bathroom.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">iii. Inviting the child to take part in sexual activity with his mother.</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">8. The sexual exploitation counts against N.R. related to Counts 33 to 48 in the indictment. Counsel for N.R. referred the court to s. 3 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998. In the margin note on the right hand side of s. 3 states, “Child trafficking and taking etc. child for sexual exploitation”. The structure of this section involves organising or facilitating the entry into, transit through or exit from the State of a child for the purposes of his or her sexual exploitation. It is in the definition section of “sexual exploitation” that the offence of introducing or coercing the child to participate in any sexual activity appears. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. Section 3 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 amends s. 3 of the 1998 Act and again gives another further definition of sexual exploitation as including at Part d “inviting, introducing or coercing the child to engage or participate in any sexual, indecent or obscene act.” O’Malley, in his book on Sexual Offences (2nd Ed.) sets out the issues of child trafficking and sexual exploitation together. The offences listed in the schedule to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 include all commonly prescribed sex offences including rape, sexual assault, incest and defilement. He describes the offence of meeting a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation which is included in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) amendment Act 2007. In relation to the charges proffered in the indictment against N.R. he states that “a charge might possibly be brought under this section where a parent or guardian sexually abused or exploited a child in a manner which did not come within the definition of any existing sexual offence.” He referred to the decision of Edwards J. in the Minister for Justice and Equality v. Adams [2011] I.E.H.C 366. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Counsel for the prosecution argued that this section contemplated child trafficking but also that there is a stand-alone offence of sexual exploitation of a child. It does not refer solely to the sexual exploitation of a child within a trafficking context. She stated that one would start with the plain words of the statute. The rules of statutory interpretation do not start with the purpose of the rule. She stated that the kind of acts as identified in the 1998 Act which could be sexual exploitation include using the child for prostitution or the production of child pornography and inducing or coercing a child participate in any sexual activity. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. In the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Minister for Justice and Equality v. Adam</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2011] I.E.H.C 366, Edwards J. was considering the issue of a sexual assault in the context of a European Arrest Warrant relating to correspondence. He stated:</font> </p>
