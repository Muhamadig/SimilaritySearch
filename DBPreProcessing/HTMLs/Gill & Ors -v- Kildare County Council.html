             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Eagar delivered on the 11th day of January, 2017</font></b> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. In this case the judicial review proceedings were solved amicably and the only issue that this Court has to deal with is the issue of costs. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. On 25th January, 2016 counsel for the applicants made an ex parte application to Murphy J. for leave to apply by way of an application for judicial review. Murphy J. on that date made an order granting the applicant leave to apply by way of judicial review for:&#x2014;</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">i. An order of </font>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">certiorari</font></i>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> quashing the respondent&#x2019;s decision of 8th January, 2016 refusing the first named applicant&#x2019;s application, made on her own behalf and on behalf of the second and third named applicants, seeking emergency homeless accommodation pursuant to s. 10 of the Housing Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;the decision of the respondent of 8th January&#x201d;);</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ii. an order of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">mandamus</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> directing the respondent to reconsider the first named applicant&#x2019;s application for emergency homeless accommodation for herself and her family pursuant to s. 10 of the Housing Act, 1988. </font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Murphy J. also granted leave for the relief of the costs of these proceedings on that date. The application for leave was grounded on the affidavit of Linda Gill, the first named applicant. She described that she was a 24 year old mother of two and had ordinarily resided in Kildare for all her life. She is the mother of T,G, who was then aged two years and nine months and E.M. (the third named respondent herein) who was 11 months at the time of the application. She described that she had been in a committed relationship with the third named respondent&#x2019;s father for over a year and lived together as co-habitees for a period of 8 months. She described that from March, 2015 to October, 2015 she resided at private rented accommodation at Apartment 1, Kildare House, Clare Gate Street, Kildare Town, Co. Kildare. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. She described that the relationship with the father of the third named respondent broke down and she left the apartment at Kildare Town with both their children in or about October, 2015. She stated that the three respondents had been homeless since leaving the Kildare House apartment. For a period of approximately 3 months she stated that they were able to stay on a temporary basis with Yvonne Maguire in Grange, Co. Meath. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. At the time Ms. Maguire was in a relationship with the first named applicant&#x2019;s father. She had hoped that she would be able to secure private rented accommodation for herself and her two small children but over the course of the last three months of 2015 she was unsuccessful despite repeated attempts. She was eligible for rent supplement and only 3 properties in Co. Kildare were within the price range allowable for rent supplement. She described that her current weekly income is &#x20ac;245.60 as she is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance while she awaits her one-parent family payment. She is also in receipt of &#x20ac;280 a month child benefit. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. She describes that in early January, 2016 she agreed to leave Ms. Maguire&#x2019;s home in circumstances where the continued presence of herself and her young children in her home was no longer sustainable. She agreed that they would move out on 7th January and she presented herself at the offices of Kildare County Council seeking emergency homeless accommodation on 6th January, 2016. She presented again on 7th January, 2016 and on both of these occasions she was refused emergency accommodation. On the night of 7th January, 2016 Ms. Yvonne Maguire, her friend, agreed to allow her to stay for one final night with her children. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. On 8th January, 2016 she again presented at Kildare County Council&#x2019;s offices seeking emergency homeless accommodation for herself and her two small children. She was again refused. She then sought the assistance of Sinead Kieran, a solicitor of the Mercy Law Resource Centre Solicitors, a firm of solicitors who provide legal advice and representation in an accessible way, to people who are homeless or at the risk of homelessness in the areas of social housing and social welfare law. Her solicitor contacted Kildare County Council by telephone but she was told that they would not speak to her for reasons of data protection. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. On 8th January, 2016 she received a letter from Mark McLoughlin, Administrative Officer of Kildare County Council, who confirmed that the first named applicant had presented to Kildare County Council Homeless Services, that she had been assessed by the Homeless Team based on information that she had provided. The letter concluded:&#x2014;</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Accordingly Kildare County Council are of the opinion that it would not be appropriate to provide emergency accommodation at this time.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">9. It is relevant for the purposes of this judgment that Mr. McLoughlin did not refer in that correspondence to the Housing Assistance Programme (hereinafter referred to as the &#x201c;HAP&#x201d;) as this is a matter which counsel for the respondent relies upon to resist this application for costs. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The first named applicant in her affidavit stated that on 8th January, 2016, having been refused emergency accommodation by the defendant, travelled to Dublin with her young children and Dublin City Council agreed to provide her with three nights of emergency homeless accommodation for the nights of the 8th, 9th and 10th January, 2016. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. On 11th January, 2016 her solicitor wrote to Kildare County Council asking that they reconsider her application for emergency homelessness accommodation and/or that they otherwise provide the first named applicant and her children with housing. The letter set out the statutory, constitutional and human rights framework within which Kildare County Council&#x2019;s powers operate in considerable detail. It also stated that judicial review would issue without further notice to them if no satisfactory response was received within seven days of the letter and on that basis the application was made to the Court. She stated that since 11th January, 2016 she has stayed for a few nights at a time with friends and family. Her father&#x2019;s partner has a 16 year old child who is severely autistic and was greatly distressed by the presence of her two small children in the home. She also refers to accommodation with her sister where she and her two children stayed in a couch area. She presented to Kildare County Council on 19th January, 2016 and was again refused emergency homelessness accommodation. She was given a letter confirming that she was on the Kildare County Council housing list as of 21st September, 2010. She says in her affidavit she is now in a desperate situation and her family is at crisis point. She is a 24 year old mother of two children and she has nowhere to sleep with her children and she has exhausted the assistance and goodwill of family and friends. She says that within a matter of days she would be forced to sleep rough with two extremely young children and she applied for the relief. Exhibited to her affidavit is the letter written by her solicitor, Sinead Kieran, dated 11th January, 2016. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. Counsel on behalf of the respondent opposed the application for costs on behalf of the applicant. She states that the &#x201c;proceedings had been rendered moot and were struck out on 18th February, 2016. The mootness was as a result of the unilateral actions of the first named applicant in obtaining private rented accommodation through the HAP. Prior to the institution of the proceedings she submits that the HAP Scheme had been made available by the respondent for the first named applicant and for these reasons the applicants should not be entitled to their costs of the within proceedings. She referred in particular to correspondence dated 16th May, 2016 in relation to the applicants&#x2019; application for their costs as follows:&#x2014;</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Proceedings were struck out after your clients secured private rental accommodation through the HAP Scheme. As you are aware, the HAP Scheme is a new social housing support. It has replaced rent supplement for those with a long term housing need. Once approved for housing, the applicant sources his or her own private rented accommodation within specific rent caps. HAP had become operational in Co. Kildare on 2nd November, 2015 [the Court notes that this was about two months before the issues that led to the application by the first named applicant]. Your client was advised of the opportunity to avail of the HAP Scheme on several occasions prior to making her application for leave to seek judicial review on 25th January, 2015. In particular, availing of the HAP Scheme was recommended to her on specific dates as follows:&#x2014;</font> 
               <ul>
                <br> 
                <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. By Ms. Nicky Reid, support worker of Focus Ireland contracted by Focus to the Homeless Support Team within Kildare County Council on 6th January. </font>

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. By Margaret Dwyer, Staff Officer in the Housing Department of Kildare County Council to Nuala, Secretary to Catherine Murphy, T.D. on 7th January. </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. By letter from Kildare County Council to Mercy Law dated 22nd January, 2016.</font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. Notwithstanding the numerous recommendations to seek private rental accommodation through the HAP Scheme, your client, for reasons better known to herself initially decided not to take up private rented accommodation. </font> </p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. Instead, she issued proceedings against our client seeking judicial review of a decision made by Kildare County Council refusing to provide emergency homelessness accommodation to your client and family.&#x201d;</font></p>
               </ul> 
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">13. By way of response the applicants&#x2019; solicitors stated it was only as a result of the respondent&#x2019;s intervention that the applicants were able to secure private rented accommodation, that this intervention could and should have occurred in advance of the issuing of the within proceedings, and as such the applicants were entitled to their costs. The respondents, by letter replied, dated 27th July, 2016, to the applicants&#x2019; solicitors pointing out that the only &#x201c;intervention&#x201d;, as described by the applicants&#x2019; solicitors which the respondent was involved in was the reiteration of the previous advice given to the applicant to obtain private rented accommodation and to point out those with private rented accommodations which were available. Counsel on behalf of the respondent referred to the following cases: </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cunningham v. President of the Circuit Court and the Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2012] IESC 38&#x2014; this related to an application to prohibit a criminal trial. The relief had been refused by McKechnie J. in the High Court in 2007 but while the appeal was pending to the Supreme Court the Director of Public Prosecutions entered </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">nolle prosequi</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> in proceedings, rendering moot the question of whether it should have been appropriate to prohibit the criminal trial. The reason why the Director of Public Prosecutions had entered a </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">nolle prosequi</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> was because of the death of a vital witness. Clarke J. in giving the judgment of the Supreme Court in relation to the costs principles said as follows:&#x2014;</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;[4.1] </font>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">There can be little doubt but that the normal rule is that costs follow the event. This stems from O. 99, (Rule 4) of the Rules of the Superior Courts and has been the subject of many judicial comments such as that of Denham J. in</font></i>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> Grimes v. Punchestown Developments Co. Ltd [2002] 4 I.R. 515. </font>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">It also appears clear that the rule is equally applicable to the costs of appeal. See for example</font></i>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> S.P.U.C. v. Coogan (No. 2) [1991] 1 I.R. 273.</font> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[4.2] It is, of course, the case that there are exceptions to that general rule. A somewhat different approach is sometimes taken in cases involving points of law of exceptional public importance or test cases or the like. There also may be difficult cases where the question of who has won the &#x201c;event&#x201d; may not be as clear cut as might arise in more straightforward proceedings. However, none of those issues seem to me to have any application to the facts of this case.&#x201d;</font></i> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At para. 4.5:&#x2014; </font> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;[4.5] The problem in dealing with the costs of proceedings which have become moot is that there will, in reality, be no event which those costs have to follow.&#x201d; </font></i> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At para. 4.8 he states:&#x2014;</font> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;[4.8] It must, of course, be acknowledged that some cases which have become moot may not fit neatly into the category of proceedings which have become moot due to entirely external events, on the one hand, or due to the unilateral action of one of the parties, on the other hand. In particular there will be cases where the immediate reason why proceedings have become moot is because a statutory officer or body has decided not to go ahead with a threatened course of action (such as the criminal prosecution in this case). However, the reason why it may have been necessary or appropriate for that statutory officer or body to adopt a changed position may, to a greater or lesser extent, be due to wholly external factors.&#x201d;</font></i> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At para. 4.9 :&#x2014;</font> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;[4.9] In that context it is, of course, important to note that statutory officers and bodies have an obligation to exercise their powers in a proper manner. If circumstances change then it is, of course, not only reasonable but necessary for such officers and bodies to reflect the new circumstances by adopting a position (even if different) which takes into account the circumstances as they have come to be. The mere fact, therefore, that a statutory officer or body adopts a changed position which renders judicial review proceedings moot does not, of itself, necessarily mean that it is appropriate to characterise the proceedings as having become moot by reason of a unilateral act of one party.</font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[4.10] If there were no change in underlying circumstances and if the statutory officer or body had simply changed his or its mind or adopted a new and different view, then such a characterisation might be appropriate. Where, however, there is an underlying change of circumstance, it is necessary to consider the extent to which it can properly be said that the proceedings have become moot by reason of the unilateral act of one party, on the one hand or, in reality have become moot by reason of a change in underlying circumstances outside the control of either party, on the other hand.&#x201d;</font></i></p>
