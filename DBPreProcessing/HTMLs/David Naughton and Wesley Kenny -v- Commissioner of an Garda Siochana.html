             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This is an application to prohibit disciplinary proceedings initiated against the applicants who are serving members of An Garda Síochána. The Applicants in the alternative are seeking declarations that the relevant regulations are not being implemented in the appropriate manner. The application was heard on the 7th of December 2016 and judgment was reserved.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. By order of the 28th of October 2015 the applicants were granted leave to bring judicial review proceedings for the following reliefs:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) An order of prohibition by way of application for judicial review restraining the respondent from the taking of any further steps and from taking any further action in discipline proceedings regarding the applicants which are presently pending under and by virtue of the provisions of An Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 2007.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) An order of prohibition by way of application for judicial review restraining the respondent, her servants or agents from the taking of any further steps in and about disciplinary enquiry which is presently being carried out on and conducted under and by virtue of the provisions of An Garda Síochána Discipline Regulations 2007.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) A declaration by way of application for judicial review that the respondent has acted in excess of authority conferred and/or that the respondent&#x2019;s actions are ultra vires in and about the conduct of an investigation and the conduct of disciplinary proceedings which said disciplinary proceedings have been commenced pursuant to the provisions of Regulation 24 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 2007. The said proceedings now fall outside the scope of the Regulations by virtue of the provisions of Regulations 8(2)(a) and (b) thereof.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) A declaration by way of application for judicial review that the disciplinary proceedings insofar as they have been commenced and carried on and concern the applicant are unfair and oppressive. </font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">The application is grounded on a statement to ground application for judicial review of 27th October 2015 and the affidavits of verification of David Naughton and Wesley Kenny sworn on the 27th of October 2015 together with the exhibits. A notice of motion issued on the 27th of October 2015 returnable originally for the 15th of December 2015. A statement of opposition was filed and served on the 19th of February 2016 together with an affidavit of Garda Superintendant Matt Nylon sworn on the 17th of February 2016. The applicant&#x2019;s solicitor Martin Moran deposed an affidavit on the 27th of April 2016.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The applicants are both members of An Garda Síochána and are stationed at Kilmainham Garda Station. Together with other friends they visited Limerick for a social weekend on 5th December 2013.. They became involved in an incident which led to their criminal prosecution for assault contrary to s. 2 of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. The applicants were acquitted of this charge at Limerick District Court on the 13th of November 2014 after a contested trial.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. Separately the applicants were served on the 6th of February 2014 with a notice dated the 29th of January 2014 informing them that an investigating officer had been appointed pursuant to Regulation 24 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 2007 to carry out a disciplinary investigation. On the 31st of August 2015 the chairperson of a Board of Inquiry set up to carry out the inquiry wrote to both applicants in accordance with Regulation 27 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 2007 and supplied them with particulars of the serious breach of discipline alleged and enclosed all relevant materials and informed them that the Board of Inquiry hearing would take place on the 28th of September 2015. The documentation furnished with the notification included particulars of the breach alleged, a statement of facts established by the investigation and a copy of all statements taken by the investigating officer and video stills but did not make any reference to the District Court criminal proceedings nor were statements taken in relation to the criminal investigation included.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The alleged breach of discipline before the board was:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) Discreditable conduct that is to say that you Garda Wesley Kenny 34735C Kilmainham Garda Station on the 5th of December 2013 at Catherine Street, Limerick conducted yourself in a manner which you ought to have known would be reasonably likely to bring discredit on the Garda Síochána in that you did attempt to gain access to an apartment building at 15 Upper Cecil Street, Limerick seeking the services of a prostitute.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) A similar allegation has been made against David Naughton</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The Board of Inquiry sat on the 28th September 2015 and proceeded to hear submissions. Mr Moran Solicitor for the Applicants made a number of submissions to the Board of Inquiry by way of preliminary application which are summarised as follows:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&#x2022; </font>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">That all information regarding the criminal prosecution ought to be before the Board of Inquiry.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2022; That the particulars of breach were improperly formulated as the Respondent had formulated them and must as a matter of law be formulated by the Board.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2022; That the disciplinary proceedings ought to be discontinued by reason of the provisions of Regulation 8 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 2007. </font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The Board adjourned to consider the submissions and on 15th October 2015 in summary decided that:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&#x2022; </font>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">The disciplinary matter was separate and distinct from the charges before the District Court</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2022; It would not be unfair or oppressive to commence or to continue disciplinary proceedings</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2022; That it was open to the Respondent to draft/formulate the breaches of discipline.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2022; It was acceptable that the Board of Inquiry was not furnished with information regarding the criminal prosecution.</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">8. By reason of the aforementioned the Applicants sought and obtained the leave order.</font>

              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Lest it be considered that acquittal on a criminal charge necessarily precludes a disciplinary investigation into the facts arising out of which a criminal charge was brought I reject such a proposition. The argument in support of such view is one of estoppel. The vital features of issue estoppel are that the fact and the parties in dispute are essentially the same. Where one organ of State has been a contestant in the first trial of the issue, then, in my view, another organ of State has the necessary privity. What is an organ of State? Certainly, the Attorney General, Ireland, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána come within that category. The core question is whether or not the issue was the same. The issue in a criminal trial is the guilt or innocence of the accused; such depends upon a wide variety of circumstances the existence of which has to be proved by the prosecution. As pointed out by Henchy J. in </font>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dublin Corporation v. Flynn</font></i>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1980] I.R. 157, for a variety of reasons an accused person may have been prepared to accept a wrong decision in an earlier prosecution to the effect that he had committed an act of assault or had driven a motor car dangerously. In such circumstances, estoppel would be repugnant to the fair administration of justice. In the instant case the claim of estoppel is made by the accused but the legal principle is the same. Acquitting a garda of assault would not preclude a garda investigation into a breach of discipline such as abuse of authority in failing to behave with due courtesy towards a member of the public.

Such estoppel would arise, not only in relation to the specific issue determined (in this case, whether the statement was made freely and voluntarily) but also to findings which were fundamental to the court's decision on such issue.&#x2019;</font>

              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;I am satisfied that in the present case the circumstances are not such that to allow the disciplinary process to proceed would be unfair or oppressive. The allegations in the disciplinary proceedings are not even the same as the charge before the District Court, let alone identical. Nor do the disciplinary proceedings involve any determination on the issue of possession or create the risk of unravelling the District Court verdict.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While the remaining matters before the inquiry arise out of the same set of events as the possession allegation, they are quite different in character. During the course of the hearing I invited counsel for the applicant to consider whether the instant case was any different from the situation which might arise where a garda, stopped at a road checkpoint, is charged with drunken driving in circumstances where a criminal charge to that effect is later unsuccessful but where, at the time of being stopped, the garda in question had identified himself as a member of the Garda Síochána with a view to avoiding a breath test and had used abusive and insulting language. Could it be said that a disciplinary inquiry into those latter events would be either unfair or oppressive? It seems to me that to ask the question is to know the answer. It would not.&#x201d;</font></p>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">22. Kearns P. was interpreting the 2007 Regulations.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">23. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McKenna v. Commissioner of an Garda Síochána</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, a recent decision on garda disciplinary regulations of Baker J. of 18th March, 2016, the judgments in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McGrath, Garvey</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Walsh</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> were approved in the context of the 2007 Regulations. At paras. 31, 32, 33 and 34, she stated:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;31. The balance of Regulation 8 provides for and entitles a Board of Inquiry or an appeal board to treat as conclusive findings of fact in a criminal charge.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">32. Regulation 8 therefore permits the commencement or continuation of disciplinary proceedings where a member has been acquitted even if those proceedings involve an inquiry into the same issues in respect of which the member was so acquitted but only if, in all the circumstances of the particular case, and their cumulative effects means that it would not be unfair and oppressive to continue the proceedings.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">33. Thus, as Regulation 8 expressly provides for the circumstances that have arisen in the present case, I reject the argument of counsel for the applicant that there is no statutory or other basis on which the disciplinary inquiry may be continued, merely on account of the fact that he has been acquitted of criminal charges arising from the same or broadly the same set of facts and circumstances. The proceedings may be continued, unless fairness or injustice would result, but there is no absolute statutory or other provision that supports the argument of the applicant that the conduct of the enquiry is </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ultra vires</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the respondent.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">34. The same set of facts can give rise to concerns of a criminal or disciplinary concern, and there is nothing intrinsically unfair or illogical in this. In matters not involving members of An Garda Síochána, a set of circumstances can give rise to civil liability and criminal prosecution. In either case the outcome of the criminal trial may well create an issue estoppel, but absent such argument there is no legal or evidential impediment to the prosecution of a civil and criminal trial out of the same factual nexus.&#x201d;</font></p>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">, is no longer relevant or that the decision in Walsh was based on an application of the Regulations prior to those subject of this inquiry is incorrect. Baker J. relied on these authorities. The core principles enunciated in the </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McGrath</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> judgment are relevant in the consideration of the 2007 Regulations. The fact that the wording of s. 8 has somewhat changed and is broader than previous Regulations is not relevant in the consideration of this application.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">25. The respondent was incorrect to argue that a Board of Inquiry could not rely on a criminal conviction in a criminal trial. It is open to a Board to do so, and a criminal conviction may of itself be a serious breach of discipline. The Commissioner is the correct respondent in the proceedings.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">26. The applicants have further submitted that an inquiry pursued by a Board of Inquiry pursuant to Part 3 of the Regulations is, in its totality, an inquisitorial one and rely on the Supreme Court decision of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Kelly v. Commissioner of An Garda Síochána</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, decision of 5th November, 2013. O&#x2019;Donnell J stated at para 32:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;As counsel for the appellant has pointed out, the Board of Inquiry does not conform to the model of the decision maker coming to a dispute with no prior knowledge, which can be encountered in other areas of the law. There is an inquisitorial element to this procedure. It is for the Board of Inquiry to formulate the breaches of discipline alleged and provide particulars thereof, and to provide notice of such allegations to the member concerned. It follows therefore that the Board of Inquiry will have had some degree of prior engagement with the facts, and importantly in the present context, will have made some assessment of their significance. It is also important that while the Board of Inquiry makes a decision in relation to the fact of breach, that decision is not final and may be appealed to the Appeal Board. Furthermore, the Board itself does not impose a sanction, but rather recommends it. It is for the Commissioner to decide, in the light of the Board&#x2019;s determination of the facts, and recommendation as to penalty, what penalty he or she considers appropriate. Thus, in every case the conclusion of the Board&#x2019;s inquiry must go to another decision maker (the Commissioner and in some cases the Government) and in many cases will be considered by a third decision maker (the Appeal Board). Thus, when the Regulations impose an obligation on the Board of Inquiry to &#x201c;submit a written report to the Commissioner&#x201d; such an obligation must be read in the light that the Regulations themselves contemplate important decisions being made, and possibly reviewed, on foot of that written report. This in itself is suggests that the Regulations contemplated a narrative setting out the views, and therefore the reasons, of the Board.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">27. The applicants thus argue that there is an onus on the Board of Inquiry on its own initiative to bring before it the evidence heard in the District Court criminal prosecution.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">28. The respondents submit that the onus is not on the Board but the Applicants to raise the issue at the inquiry. Paragraph 75 of the respondents legal submissions states:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;It is further submitted that the argument that the Board of Inquiry failed to have any or any adequate regard for the investigation, proceedings and outcome before the District Court does not stand up to scrutiny. What the Board decided in its ruling of 15th October 2015 was that if the Applicants&#x2019; solicitor believed it was appropriate to call any evidence or witnesses in relation to the District Court matter he could make an application to the Board of Inquiry and the Board would consider that application. It is noteworthy that no such application was made to the Board and therefore it is difficult to see how the Applicants can argue that the Board of Inquiry failed to have regard to the proceedings and outcome of the District Court proceedings or refused to inquire into the circumstances of the prosecution and the acquittal in the District Court, when no application was made by the Applicants solicitors, after the Board of Inquiry ruling, for such evidence to be adduced before the Board of Inquiry.&#x201d; </font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">29. One issue which is of some concern to the court is that the regulations do not specify who is responsible for implementing a decision pursuant to section 8(2)(a) and (b). to commence, continue or discontinue a disciplinary hearing. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">30. The wording of s. 8(2)(a) and (b) implies that a decision maker is not precluded from proceeding with an inquiry into the same issue in respect of which the member is acquitted in a criminal prosecution unless in all the circumstances of the particular case and the cumulative effect, it would be unfair and oppressive to commence or continue the proceedings. Section 8(2)(a) is not a stand alone provision but has to be read in conjunction with section 8(2)(b). </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">31. There is nothing in the Regulations to prevent an investigating officer appointed by the Commissioner pursuant to s. 23 of the Regulations making a recommendation pursuant to section 8. It is open to the Commissioner not to commence disciplinary proceedings if s. 8(2)(a) and (b) applies. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">32. There may be occasions when s. 8(2)(a) applies, but it is still obvious from an investigating officer&#x2019;s report that the statements taken disclose a prima facie case of a serious breach of discipline.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">33. It is open to an investigating officer as part of an investigation where a criminal prosecution has been initiated against a member and the member has been acquitted to recommend that a </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> case of a serious breach of discipline separately from the facts in issue in the criminal prosecution arises although for investigation purposes, the series of events is treated as one. This is the situation here. </font> </p>
