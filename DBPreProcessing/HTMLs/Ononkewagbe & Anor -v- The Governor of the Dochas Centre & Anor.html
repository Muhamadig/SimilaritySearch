             <br> 
             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Bernard J. Barton delivered on the 7th day of April, 2017.</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The Applicants are foreign aliens who had been the subject matter of deportation orders dated 28th November, 2008, which were not complied with. Ultimately, on 26th July, 2016, the first Applicant was arrested in her home at the Mosney Accommodation Centre, County Meath pursuant to s. 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999 as substituted and amended by s. 78 of the International Protection Act, 2015 for the purposes of giving effect to the deportation orders. The first Applicant packed bags for herself and her daughter, the second Applicant. She complied with her mother&#x2019;s requests to get dressed and go with her to Dublin Airport. Shortly before the time for boarding the aircraft on which they were to be flown out of the State the Applicants were requested to board the plane, however, they refused to cooperate further with the deportation process as a consequence of which the first Applicant was arrested and incarcerated in the Dochas Centre at Mountjoy and the second Applicant was taken into care by the second Respondent. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. It was against this background that the Applicants instituted these proceedings under Article 40 of the Constitution for an enquiry into the lawfulness of their detention and in respect of which the judgment of the Court was delivered on 10th August, 2016, on foot of which the detention of the Applicants was found to be lawful. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Each of the parties have sought orders for their costs in respect of which written and oral submissions have been made and considered by the Court. It is not considered necessary to repeat or summarise these for the purposes of this judgment. Suffice it to say that the Respondents point of departure on their applications was that having regard to the well settled principles applicable to the exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make an award for the costs of the proceedings there were no good or sufficient reasons or special circumstances which would warrant a departure by the Court from the general rule that costs should follow the event.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. Additionally, the Respondents contend that as the Applicants chose not to apply at the commencement of the proceedings for legal aid under the Custody Issues Scheme for which, given the nature of the proceedings and their limited financial circumstances, it is likely they would have qualified, they ran the risk that in the event they were unsuccessful they would be exposed to costs orders in favour of the Respondents in addition to having to meet their own costs whereas under the Scheme such risk would have been avoided.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The kernel of the central controversy between the parties is concerned with whether or not there are special circumstances or factors in this case which warrant the Court in departing from the ordinary rule that costs follow the event.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. Not surprisingly the Applicants take issue with the submissions of the Respondents and in their turn submit that there are such special circumstances in this case, that these are evident from the judgment delivered by the Court and that they found the basis upon which the Court&#x2019;s discretion could and should be exercised by making an award for some or all of their costs.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The law.</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The jurisdiction of the Court to make an order for costs in civil proceedings is to be found in s. 14 (2) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, the Civil Liability and Courts Acts and in the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1986, as amended. Order 99 Rule (1) (4) of the RSC provides that costs shall follow the event unless the Court orders otherwise, accordingly, the provision recognises that the Court retains a discretion in the exercise of its jurisdiction which in turn is governed by what are now well established principles. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. Having regard to the authorities opened to the Court on the subject I see no reason to depart from the view of the law concerning the ambit of the discretion which I expressed in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">A.Q. v. The Minister for Health</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IEHC 556, where at para. 5 of the judgment it is stated:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;There is no hard and fixed rule or principle which determines the ambit of the Court&#x2019;s discretion and in particular there is no overriding principle which directs that it must be exercised in favour of an unsuccessful party in specific circumstances or in a certain class or category of case rather it is to be exercised in a reasoned fashion having due regard to the special circumstances of the particular case and where the interest of justice so require.&#x201d;</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">9. The rational for the power to make or refuse an order for some or all of the costs of a party in legal proceedings is to be found in the constitutional right of access to the courts and as a means to aid the efficient and effective administration of justice by ensuring the appropriate fair and proper conduct of litigation. In general it may be said that where the circumstances are such that the citizen is required to have recourse to the courts for the purposes of asserting legal interests or having legal rights vindicated it would, in principle, be unjust if in contested proceedings which were successful the citizen is to be visited with the costs involved and so too it may be said for the party who, if successful, contests the claims made, a principle which finds its expression in the rule that costs follow the event. See </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Veolia Water U.K. Plc v. Fingal County Council (No. 2)</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2007] 2 I.R. 81 and </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Godsil v. Ireland</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] IESC 103.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Where departure from the ordinary rule falls for consideration the Court is required to exercise its discretion on a reasoned basis indicating or identifying factors or a combination of factors which, in the particular circumstances of the case and in the interests of justice, warrants the departure. See </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dunne v. Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2008] 2 I.R. 775.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. When consideration is had, as it must be, for the principle on which the rule is founded, it is necessary that any departure from it must be rooted in the special circumstances of the particular case and mandated by the requirements of justice.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. In this case the Applicants submitted that the particular circumstances involved a determination on legal issues of special and general public importance over and above the interests of the litigants alone and that in relation to those issues this was a &#x201c;test case&#x201d; of the type identified by Clarke J. in his judgement delivered on 12th October, 2007, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cork County Council v. Shackleton and Anor</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, subsequently reported at [2011] 1 I.R. 443, and adopted by the Supreme Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#x2019;Keeffe v. Hickey and Anor</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 2 I.R. 302.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. As to that, the Applicants identified two particular matters which fell for consideration by the Court which involved the construction of statutory provisions namely s. 5 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 as substituted by s. 78 of the International Protection Act 2015 and ss. 12 and 13 of the Childcare Act 1991. Insofar as the first of these provisions is concerned they contended that this was the first time on which the Court was required to consider whether the provisions of s. 5 (11) permitted the designated member of An Garda Siochana or the designated Immigration Officer, as the case may be, to enter a dwelling for the purpose of making an arrest of a person pursuant to s. 5 (1) of the Immigration Act 1999. The relevant provisions were set out in the principle judgment and will not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that s. 5 (11) does not contain any express provision which enables the Immigration Officer or the member of An Garda Síochána entering the dwelling for the purposes of effecting such an arrest to be accompanied by other immigration officers or members of An Garda Síochána. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. The Applicants had submitted that in the absence of such a provision and in the absence of any invitation to enter the dwelling, the presence of other gardaí in the applicants dwelling with the arresting officer was unlawful and thus tainted the arrest of the first Applicant.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The first Respondent submitted that that point was without merit and drew the attention of the Court to the wording of section s. 6 (2) of the Criminal Law Act, 1997 which was almost identical, moreover, no such point had ever been taken arising from the presence in a dwelling of other members of the gardaí with the officer making the arrest. It had always been the case that the officer designated to affect a search and make an arrest on a premises was entitled to be accompanied by other officers. Had there had been any proper basis in law for the proposition advanced on behalf of the Applicants it would have long since been taken and adjudicated upon, however, the first Respondent was not in a position to open an authority to support the proposition and it appeared that the point, if taken, had never been decided or, if it had, the case was unknown. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. The Applicants submitted that the wording of s. 5(11) of the Act of 1999 was not identical to s.6 (
