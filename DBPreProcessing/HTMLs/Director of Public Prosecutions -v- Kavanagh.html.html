             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of the Court delivered on the 2nd day of May 2017 by Mr. Justice Mahon</font></b> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. On 6th July 2016 at Dundalk Circuit Criminal Court the respondent pleaded guilty and was convicted of two counts, namely:- </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">• Possession of a double barrelled sawn off shotgun with intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s. 27(b)(i) of the Firearms Act 1964 as substituted by s. 60 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, and amended by s. 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007. </font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">• Robbery contrary to s. 14 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The respondent was sentenced on 21st July 2016 to a term of imprisonment of four years, with the final two years of the sentence suspended on conditions in respect of the first count. Count two was taken into consideration. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. This is the appellant’s application for a review of sentence pursuant to s. 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 on the grounds that it was unduly lenient. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. Both counts arose from an incident which occurred on 20th April 2015 at a Mace Store at Clogherhead in Co. Louth. The store included a sub post office. At about 12.30p.m. two individuals entered the premises when there were present three staff members and some customers. Both wore hoods. One carried a sawn off shotgun while the second, the respondent, carried a plastic bag. One of the individuals demanded cash from the staff member in charge of the post office section of the premises. The individual carrying the shotgun used it to strike the glass panel at the post office unit causing it to shatter. The shotgun was also pointed directly at a staff member, Miss Rafferty, and a sum of €2,250 in cash was handed over. On leaving the premises, the raiders were challenged by Det. Gda. Carey who had been sitting outside in an unmarked garda car. He produced his official issue firearm, in response to which the raider carrying the shotgun pointed it directly at him. The man then dropped the shotgun, and he and the respondent, and the driver of the raider’s vehicle, who had remained in the car during the robbery, escaped. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. The respondent ran towards the back of the premises where he was later apprehended. The raiders’ car was driven at Det. Gda. Carey who was forced to jump out of its way. He was nevertheless struck on the hip and ankle but not injured. The cash was recovered at the scene. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The respondent cooperated, to an extent, with the garda�. He refused to name his fellow robbers. He told the garda� that the raid had been planned only a couple of hours before hand.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The respondent has fifteen previous convictions for a variety of offences including drugs convictions and two for possession of firearms and ammunition in July 2015 for which he received a prison sentence of five years. This offence was committed just three months subsequent to the instant offence. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 provides as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana"> “2(1) If it appears to the Director of Public Prosecutions that a sentence imposed by a court (in this act referred to as the sentencing court) on conviction of a person on indictment was unduly lenient, he may apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentence.” </font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">9. A summary of the grounds on which this application is brought is as follows:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) The failure by the learned sentencing judge to sentence in accordance with the provisions of s. 27B and s. 27C of the Firearms Act 1964, as amended. In particular, it was contended that there was a failure to engage with the requirement of s. 27B(4) which provides for a minimum terms of five years imprisonment unless a sentencing court is satisfied that there are</font>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> exceptional and specific circumstances relating to the offence, or the person convicted of it </font></i>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">which would render such a minimum term unjust.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) It is submitted that a sentence must be imposed for each offence in respect of which a person is convicted. It is contended that the learned sentencing judge erred in taking into consideration count two, namely robbery contrary to s. 14 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, and ought instead have separately sentenced in relation to that count. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) The learned sentencing judge failed to attach appropriate weight to a number of aggravating factors, including, the planning of the robbery, the wearing of gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, the contribution to the intimidating conduct within the premises in the course of the robbery, the effect on the victims, the fact that he was part of a common design when the firearm was pointed at Det. Gda. Carey and the fact that a firearm was used, and was used to threaten.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) Undue weight was attached to the respondent’s plea of guilty in that he was effectively caught red handed, and the other mitigating factors.</font></p>
              </ul>

               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(6) The court, in considering for the purposes of subsection (5) of this section whether a sentence of not less than 5 years imprisonment is unjust in all the circumstances, may also have regard, in particular, to:-</font></i>

The respondent pleaded guilty to counts one and two, but was only specifically sentenced in relation to count one, the count relating to the possession of the double barrel sawn off shotgun.

               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> “When a person is convicted whether by plea or otherwise, of several offences, he should be sentenced separately for each even if it is intended that some or all of the sentences should run concurrently. It was so held by the Supreme Court in DPP v. Higgins (unreported, Supreme Court, November 22nd 1985), where it appeared that the accused having been convicted of several offences arising from the same incident had been sentenced on one count only with the others taken into consideration. Finlay C.J. described this arrangement as undesirable and unsatisfactory in view of the possibility that the conviction on one of the counts, including perhaps the one in respect of which a definite sentence was imposed, might be set aside or appeal or review. Convictions on other counts would remain intact so it was important to be able to identify the sentences which remained in being.” </font></i>

In the instant case the learned sentencing judge decided to take the second count into consideration without first seeking the consent of the appellant, nor was such consent forthcoming. The issue was not raised in any shape or form by either side either before or after sentencing. It is apparent from the transcript that the decision to take the second count into consideration was almost an afterthought on the part of the learned sentencing judge, prompted by prosecution counsel reminding him that there was a second count to be dealt with. The learned sentencing judge responded thus:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> “Oh, yes, two counts, I beg your pardon. In relation to the robbery charge, I’ll take it into consideration.” </font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">18. It is certainly the case that it is common practice that all types of offences are taken into consideration with one or more offences in respect of which specific sentences are handed down. It is not done on the basis that such offences are ignored; rather, they are accounted for within the overall or effective sentence imposed in relation to one or more specific counts. The practice is, if nothing else, a useful means of giving effect to the principles of totality and proportionality. It is a practice often adopted as a way of dealing with minor counts in circumstances where one or more counts of a more serious nature are being dealt with, for example, a count of dangerous driving causing death will frequently be the subject of a specific sentence while accompanying less serious counts such as, for example, leaving the scene of an accident or driving without a driving licence are simply taken into consideration. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. That said, the court is satisfied, that it is appropriate, and is required by law, that each count of which a person stands convicted should be the subject of a separate and distinct sentence unless the court relates to a minor offence that would ordinarily attract a relatively insignificant penalty. The logic for doing so is well illustrated in the remarks of Finlay C.J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Higgins</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (see above). It makes particular sense to do so where serious offences are concerned such as, as in the instant case, the offence of robbery.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. While the failure on the part of the learned sentencing judge to specifically sentence the respondent in respect of the robbery offence constitutes an error of principle, the court is anxious to emphasise that it was an error made perfectly understandably in circumstances where the issue in question was not brought to his attention.</font><br> </p>
