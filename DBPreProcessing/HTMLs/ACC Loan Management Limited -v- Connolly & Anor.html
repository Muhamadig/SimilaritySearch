             <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Where a parent guarantees a substantial business loan for one of his or her children, is the lending bank obliged to take appropriate steps to ensure that the surety has received independent legal advice prior to the execution of the guarantee? That is essentially the question presented by this application for summary judgment on the part of the creditor bank, ACC Loan Management Ltd., who now sues on foot of the guarantee given by a father in respect of his son&#x2019;s business debts following default on the part of the debtor. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the judgment of Ms. Justice Finlay Geoghegan and I gratefully adopt her summary of the facts. In her judgment Finlay Geoghegan J. has also helpfully set out the basis on which Fullam J. arrived at his conclusions in the High Court on 12th February 2015. In the light of that summary it is sufficient to say that Fullam J. found no arguable defence in respect of the first guarantee (which had been executed in 2005) because the surety, Mr. Maurice Connolly, had executed a document which had been prepared by the solicitors who were acting for his son, Mr. John Connolly, to the effect that he had waived his opportunity for independent legal advice. Mr. John Connolly was the borrower. So far as the second guarantee (which had been executed in 2009) was concerned, Fullam J. ruled that an arguable defence had been raised in the absence of any similar declaration regarding independent legal advice: see </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ACC Bank plc v. Connolly</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] IEHC 188. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. At the outset I should first observe that the second defendant, Mr. Maurice Connolly, has not sworn any affidavit in support of this defence. This omission has done his case few favours and has greatly complicated the task of both the High Court and this Court.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. As a further preliminary, I should say that I entirely agree with the conclusions of Finlay Geoghegan J. that the Court should extend the time for the bringing of an appeal against the decision of the High Court. I also agree with her conclusions regarding the execution of the deed under seal. I accordingly propose first to proceed to a consideration of the question of whether a surety should be given an opportunity for independent legal advice both by reference to the authorities (Part II) and to the issue of principle (Part III). I will then consider in Part IV the impact of two very recent decisions of this Court, de </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Kretser v. Ulster Bank</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2016] IECA 371 and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Curran v.

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> and, indeed, in the judgment of Finlay Geoghegan J. in this case which she has just delivered. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. I have already expressed in summary form my views on this topic in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">de Kretser</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and it is probably unnecessary to repeat them here. It is sufficient perhaps to observe that those comments were, of course, made in the context of the threshold for summary judgment and whether the wife (who was the surety for her husband&#x2019;s business loans) had raised an arguable defence. It is true, of course, that the decisions in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#x2019;Brien</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Etridge </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">are all predicated upon a claim of undue influence on the part of surety vis-à-vis her husband. It is also the case that no such claim is made in express terms in this case.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. It is, however, necessary, I think, to understand the context in which such a claim was made. The claims of undue influence advanced in the standard modern authorities &#x2013; the special facts of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Roche</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> represent something of an exception to this trend &#x2013; are not, however, directly comparable to what one might term the classic </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Allcard v. Skinner</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">-style instances of undue influence where the contention is that the plaintiff has been the victim of deceitful or knavish trickery or otherwise overbearing conduct. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Allcard v. Skinner</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (1887) 36 Ch.D. 145 the English Court of Appeal found that the plaintiff &#x2013; who had donated most of her assets to a convent &#x2013; had been unduly influenced by reason of what Lindley L.J. described as &#x201c;insidious forms of spiritual tyranny.&#x201d;</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. With the exception of Roche (where Clarke J. found that the partner in question who had guaranteed the debt was in an abusive relationship), none of the recent cases involving a family member acting as surety for the business debts of a spouse, partner or off-spring have presented </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Allcard v. Skinner</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">-type issues of undue influence. Rather, the classic example &#x2013; illustrated by the facts of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#x2019;Brien </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">and many of the individual eight cases heard by the House of Lords in the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Etridge</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> litigation &#x2013; is that of the stay-at-home wife who is asked to provide a guarantee in respect of the family home as security for the husband&#x2019;s business loan. When the surety is called upon to honour the guarantee, the response is to plead undue influence in the sense of reliance upon the husband of whose business dealings she had but imperfect knowledge. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. It is in these circumstances that the bank is put on inquiry to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to ensure that the spouse in question is fully aware of the extent of her obligations qua surety. As the headnote to the report of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Etridge</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> puts the matter:</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;Where a wife sought to impugn a transaction into which she had entered on the ground of her husband's undue influence their relationship did not fall within a special category of case where an irrebuttable presumption of trust and confidence arose. If she was able on the facts of the particular case to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">establish that she had placed trust and confidence in her husband in the management of her financial affairs and that the impugned transaction was not explicable in the ordinary way</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, she could rely on a presumption which, as an evidential forensic tool, shifted the burden of proof to her opponent and could be rebutted on appropriate evidence by that party. Since the fortunes of husband and wife were ordinarily bound up together, a guarantee given by the wife with a charge on her interest in the matrimonial home to secure her husband&#x2019;s debts was not plainly to her disadvantage so as to be explicable only on the basis that the transaction had been procured by his undue influence. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whenever a wife offered to stand surety for the indebtedness of her husband or his business, or a company in which they both had some shareholding, the lender was put on inquiry and was obliged to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that she had understood and freely entered into the transaction&#x2026;</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d; (emphasis supplied)</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. I consider that the words which I have taken the liberty of highlighting illustrate the potential application of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Etridge</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the circumstances of the present case. In this case, there is every reason to suppose that &#x2013; and, this is, in any event, implicit in the affidavit sworn by John Connolly &#x2013; Mr. Maurice Connolly reposed his trust in his son in the management of the latter&#x2019;s business affairs. Nor is there anything to suggest that the father stood to gain personally by the giving of a guarantee for such large sums. Here is a case plain and simple where the father offered to stand surety for the indebtedness of his son for large sums of money and, on at least one view of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Etridge</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, I find it difficult to see why the bank was not put on inquiry to ensure that the father had understood and freely entered into the transaction and to take appropriate steps accordingly. As Fullam J. pointed out in his judgment in the High Court, as it happens, in similar circumstances Birmingham J. suggested (while still a judge of the High Court) that parents who guaranteed an off-spring&#x2019;s commercial debts might be in a position to raise an </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Etridge</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">-style defence: see </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ACC Bank plc v. McEllin</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2015] IEHC 454, para. 30. While these comments were admittedly obiter &#x2013; since Birmingham J. had found on the facts of that case that the parents and the offspring had jointly come together to borrow the money for their commercial purposes &#x2013; the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McEllin</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is nonetheless indicative of an interpretation of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Etridge</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> upon which Mr. Maurice Connolly can rely, at least for the purposes of demonstrating the existence of an arguable case.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. I agree, of course, that, as I have already observed at the outset of this judgment, the fact that Mr. Maurice Connolly has not sworn any affidavit which formally sets out this defence of undue influence is a hugely complicating factor, despite the fact that he was given every opportunity to do so in the High Court. One may nevertheless reasonably infer from the available facts that the circumstances of this case are not altogether distant from that of an </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Etridge</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">-style case, save that the guarantees here were given by the parent in support of the son&#x2019;s business. Putting this another way, if the father had sworn an affidavit which formally deposed to the fact that he relied on his son and that the loans were for the son&#x2019;s business and that based on this he claimed undue influence in the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Etridge </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">sense of that term, the case for permitting him to defend on these grounds would, I think, have been irresistible. And since we know from the other available evidence that these either are or might well be the facts, the prospect of injustice raised by granting summary judgment by reason simply of the absence of an affidavit from the father is, I fear, just too great. This is why, but for the considerations of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">stare decisis</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> addressed in Part IV of this judgment, I would have held that the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Etridge</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> defence was, in principle, at least available to Mr. Maurice Connolly. This is not to say that had the matter gone to plenary hearing that Mr. Maurice Connolly would necessarily have succeeded. It is, however, to say that on that view of his defence he had, at least, raised an arguable defence so that the Bank was not entitled to summary judgment against him. </font></p>

             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#x2019;Brien, Etridge</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Roche</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">, I consider that, in any event, there is at least an arguable duty cast upon a bank by equitable principles to take steps to ensure that a potentially vulnerable surety is appropriately advised in a case of this kind. Of course, the context is everything and, for my own part, I would fight shy of prescribing ex ante rules unless the force of experience demonstrated that such was necessary. Nevertheless, that which might suffice in the case of a guarantee to cover an ordinary consumer loan (such as for a car or a domestic appliance) should not necessarily be regarded as sufficient where - as in the present case - the sums guaranteed by the two guarantees were, by any standards, very large. The loans in question amounted to sums which, if the surety were called upon to honour the full amount, could have life changing implications for him in terms of the security of his dwelling, his livelihood and any prospects he might otherwise have had in terms of living out his advancing years in any comfort or degree of financial security. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. This is certainly true in the present case where the Bank now claims judgment as against the surety in the sums of over &#x20ac;2.37m. in respect of both loans and where it was awarded summary judgment against the surety in respect of the first guarantee in the sum of &#x20ac;1.185m. (As I have already noted, in the High Court Fullam J. adjourned the claim in respect of the second guarantee in the absence of any evidence that the surety had been independently advised). One might further observe that a requirement that a bank should ensure that such a surety is appropriately advised in such circumstances does not impose significant burdens or create unnecessary barriers to supply of credit.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. It may be objected that a requirement of this kind involves the imposition of new rules or requirements for which there is no legislative sanction. One may readily concede that no modern court could justifiably invent or conjure up a new equitable principle by reference to the subjective notions of fairness and equity on the part of individual judges. If the law is considered to be unsatisfactory or inadequate, far-reaching change of this kind is reserved to the Oireachtas by Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution. Accordingly, as Lord Greene M.R. put it in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Re Diplock</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1948] Ch. 465, 481-482, if a claim &#x201c;in equity exists, it must be shown to have an ancestry, founded in history and the practice and precedents of courts administering equity jurisdiction.&#x201d;</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. To my mind, however, such a requirement as I have suggested represents simply the application in a modern context of standard principles of equity for which there is much historical precedent. From Allcard v. Skinner (1887) 36 Ch.D. 145 to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Grealish v. Murphy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1946] I.R. 35 to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lloyds Bank v. Bundy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1974] EWCA Civ 8, [1975] Q.B. 326, , equity has shown itself prepared to come to the aid of the vulnerable who were not independently legally advised where the transaction is fundamentally improvident. This is true even where &#x201c;the deed...was in law a transaction for value&#x201d;: see </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Grealish v. Murphy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1946] I.R. 35, 49 </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">per</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Gavan Duffy J.. If there is no modern willingness to re-fashion and adapt these principles to modern conditions in the case of vulnerable sureties, it may simply be that we the judges who are required to tend to the gardens of equity by ensuring that their verdure remains fresh, vibrant and relevant to the modern world have allowed an ancient path of escape from the gravel paths of the common law to become disused and overgrown.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Yet if equity will not bring that moral element to the common law and ensure that in a modern setting the vulnerable are adequately protected, the principles of equity will in time come to be seen as just another set of rules, as desiccated, inflexible and arid as they were in the days of Lord Eldon in the early 19th century. That is why I believe that this Court should be astute to hold the plaintiff as the privileged holder of a banking licence to the highest standards. This is not in any way to question the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">bona fides</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the bank, but rather to ensure &#x2013; as much for the bank&#x2019;s interest as anyone else &#x2013; that it takes appropriate precautions in the case of potentially vulnerable and elderly sureties to ensure that the implications of such a guarantee are fully understood and appreciated.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. In this regard I have not overlooked the fact that Mr. Maurice Connolly has not sworn any affidavit in support of this defence. As I have already had occasion to remark elsewhere in this judgment, this omission has done his case few favours, as many critical details relevant to our consideration of these issues are absent from our knowledge as a result. It is nonetheless not unrealistic to suppose that when Mr. Maurice Connolly first acted as surety for his son in 2005, he was at least in his 50s at the time the security was executed. While I would be the last to regard a person in his 50s as &#x201c;elderly&#x201d;, the key point here really is that Mr. Maurice Connolly put what must have been a considerable amount of personal capital at stake by way of two guarantees in support of the business venture of his son and in respect of which business venture he stood to receive no direct personal benefit. If matters went wrong, he stood to lose possibly all of that capital which, doubtless, had been accumulated after a lifetime of hard work and effort, not least his farm at Dunanore, Folksmills, Co. Wexford. It can therefore be argued that in these circumstances the transaction was fundamentally improvident so far as this guarantor was concerned, so that in the words of Lord Denning in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lloyds Bank v. Bundy</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, it is &#x201c;not right that the strong should be allowed to push the weak to the wall.&#x201d;</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. One may also fairly infer from the affidavit of his son, Mr. John Connolly, that Mr. Maurice Connolly had no involvement at all in the proposed development which was the subject of the business loan. As Mr. John Connolly explained, the loan was in respect of a development venture involving the purchase and licensing of certain lands. It would seem from that affidavit that he was the unfortunate victim of a fraud in relation to the title to those lands and that he is awaiting the outcome of an action for deceit against the alleged perpetrators of this fraud before he </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i.e.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, Mr. John Connolly) will be in a position to repay the moneys. Independently of these civil proceedings, a criminal prosecution is still pending against the two individuals who are alleged to have fabricated the title documents, an earlier conviction for fraud having been set aside by reason of an irregularity in the documents which were made available to the jury. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. In these circumstances, I believe that, but for the considerations of stare decisis which I will next address in Part IV, Mr. Maurice Connolly has established at least an arguable case that, based on the equitable principles I have already described, the bank was under a duty to ensure that he was independently advised prior to the execution of these two guarantees. It is true that, as I have already noted, Mr. John Connolly&#x2019;s solicitors provided a declaration that Mr. Maurice Connolly had been offered an opportunity of independent legal advice in respect of the first guarantee in 2005 and that this declaration was then executed by Mr. Maurice Connolly himself. But since these solicitors also acted for the borrower, Mr. John Connolly, they cannot be regarded as having provided the opportunity of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">independent </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">legal advice to Mr. Maurice Connolly: see, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">e.g.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the comments to this effect of Irvine J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Darby v. Shanley</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2009] IEHC 459. As McGovern J. stated in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Danske Bank v. Madden</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2009] IEHC 319, the usual meaning to be attributed to the term &#x201c;independent legal advice&#x201d;:</font> </p>

              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;is that it is advice obtained by the party himself from a lawyer retained by him and not advice coming from the legal advisor of a third party with whom he is entering into a legal relationship.&#x201d; </font>
              </ul> 
             </ul>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not covered by recent authority (which I will deal with in Part IV), I would have gone further than Fullam J. did in respect of the first guarantee in that I would have permitted Mr. Maurice Connolly to defend the claims in respect of </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">both guarantees</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not just simply the second guarantee. In these circumstances I would accordingly have adjourned the entirety of the Bank&#x2019;s claim to plenary hearing.</font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> and that the issue is not determined by recent authority. It is, however, clear that this is not so, at least so far as this Court is concerned, since within the last few weeks this Court has twice rejected arguments along the lines I have just canvassed.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22. In a judgment delivered on 7th December 2016 in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">de Kretser</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, I was the dissentient who argued that a surety had raised an arguable defence to the effect that the Bank was under an affirmative duty to see that she was independently advised. This argument was rejected by Birmingham J. who delivered the judgment of the majority and with whom Peart J. agreed. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">23. A similar view to that of the majority in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">de Kretser</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was taken by Irvine J. (and with whom Ryan P. and Hanna J. concurred) when she delivered the judgment of this Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Curran</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on 21st December 2016. The decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Curran</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was a case where a mother executed a guarantee for some &#x20ac;1m. in respect of her son&#x2019;s company with whom she had had a minor involvement and where she was not advised as to the necessity of securing independent legal advice. As Irvine J. stated in her judgment:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;It is only relevant to consider whether it is arguable that the bank was obliged to make inquiries to ascertain whether, having regard to her connection with the company, she fully understood and was freely entering into the guarantee, if she could first establish a credible or arguable case on the facts that she executed the guarantee in circumstances of undue influence. In turn, that required her to set out on affidavit the type of facts, details and circumstances upon which she would rely at the trial to establish that her will was overborne by her son, Michael Curran, when she executed the guarantee.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">24. It is clear from this judgment that the bank would be placed on inquiry only where </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Allcard v. Skinner</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">-type undue influence &#x2013; or, at least, something approaching this &#x2013; had been established by the surety, even in the case of parent/offspring guarantees for large sums from which the surety stood to gain no personal benefit.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">25. In these circumstances, it is plain that the settled view of this Court is to the effect that, at least absent an express claim of undue influence or a claim of misrepresentation, a bank is under no such affirmative duty to ensure that a surety receives independent legal advice. Although this Court has not yet since its establishment in October 2014 been required to formulate its own rules regarding </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">stare decisis</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, I think that by analogy with the doctrine of precedent applicable in the case of prior decisions of a co-ordinate court (see, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">e.g.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the comments of Parke J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Irish Trust Bank v. Central Bank of Ireland</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1976-1977] I.L.R.M. 50, 53 where the practice of one High Court judge following an earlier decision of another High Court judge was discussed), then absent special circumstances, an individual member of this Court should normally yield to the prevailing consensus as reflected in prior decisions of this Court which are clearly on point and which, in the words of Finlay C.J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finucane v. McMahon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1990] 1 I.R. 165, 207, represent decisions &#x201c;reached after the most comprehensive and detailed consideration of all relevant factors.&#x201d; </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">26. The decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finucane</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> had concerned the proper interpretation of the political offence exception in s. 50 of the Extradition Act 1965 in respect of which there had been a range of divergent judicial views expressed by various Supreme Court judges in the case-law leading up to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finucane</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. Even though Finlay C.J. evidently disagreed with the majority view which ultimately emerged from that case-law and in Finucane itself, he stated that he was henceforth willing to accept the majority view and adopt it as his own by reason of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">stare decisis</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. By analogy, therefore, with the approach adopted by Finlay C.J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finucane</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, I consider that it would be appropriate that I should accept and adopt this majority view as reflected in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">de Kretser</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Curran</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#x201c;so that the basic principles underlying it may clearly represent the decision of this Court&#x201d;: see [1990] 1 I.R. 165, 207.</font><br> </p>
