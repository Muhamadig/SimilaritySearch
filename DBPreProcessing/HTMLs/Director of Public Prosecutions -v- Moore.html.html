             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This is an application by the appellant to review the sentences imposed on the respondent on 12th February 21016 at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on one count of robbery contrary to s. 14 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, and one count of assault causing harm contrary to s. 3 of the Non Fatal Offences Against The Person Act 1997, pursuant to the provisions of s. 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Having pleaded guilty to the offences, the respondent was sentenced to three years and six months imprisonment in relation to count no. 1 and to two years and six months imprisonment in relation to count no. 2. The sentences were suspended in their entirety for a period of three years on certain conditions, including that the respondent would place himself under the supervision of the Probation Service for a period of one year from the date of sentence, that he would comply with all directions of the Probation Service and attend all appointments, that he would undertake offending behaviour work (including victim awareness) with the Probation Service, that he would engage in addiction support services in the community, that he would attend therapeutic support service for gambling addiction if deemed necessary by the Probation Service and that he would attend any other services deemed necessary under the auspices of the Probation Service. A sum of €900 made available by the respondent was directed to be paid to the injured party </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“as a practical expression of remorse”</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The assault occurred on the 3rd June 2013 at about 4 a.m. in the morning as the victim was making his way home after a night out. He was approached and attacked by the respondent who demanded his wallet. The respondent then kicked him about ten times on the ground and his wallet was taken. When later apprehended the wallet was found on the person of the respondent. The victim suffered a broken nose, fractures to his jaw, a soft tissue issue to his leg and bruising.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The mitigating factors referred to in the course of the sentencing judgment, and which were apparently taken into account by the learned sentencing judge include the following:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">• The plea of guilty, notified to the prosecution in advance.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">• Co-operation with the investigation.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">• Admissions made to the garda� in the course of being interviewed.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">• The assault on the victim was prompted by a misapprehension on the part of the respondent that the victim had previously struck a woman.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">• The lack of pre-mediation.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">• The fact that the victim made a good recovery from his injuries.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">• The lack of serious previous convictions. </font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">5. In the course of his sentencing judgment, the learned sentencing judge also referred to the respondent’s </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“significant medical difficulties”</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">. His good education, his remorse, his practical expression of that remorse. The learned sentencing judge stated that </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“The court has to mark the seriousness of the offence”</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> before continuing to the effect that he also had to take into account the personal circumstances of the respondent. He then proceeded to impose sentence on the respondent but suspended the entire of the term imposed for the aforesaid reasons. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 provides as follows:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> "2(1) If it appears to the Director of Public Prosecutions that a sentence imposed by a court (in this Act referred to as the sentencing Court) on conviction of a person on indictment was unduly lenient, he may apply (to the Court of Appeal) to review the sentence. </font></i> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 2(2) On such an application, the Court may either:-</font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (a) quash the sentence and in place of it impose on the convicted person such sentence as it considers appropriate, being a sentence which could have been imposed on him by the sentencing court concerned, or </font></i> </p>
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (b) refuse </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">the application.”</font></p>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2000] 4 I.R. 356, Barron J. stated (referring to s. 2 of the 1993 Act) as follows:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> “In the view of the court, undue leniency connotes a clear divergence by the court of trial from the norm and would, save perhaps in exceptional circumstances, have been caused by an obvious error in principle.</font></i> 
               <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Each case must depend upon its special circumstances. The appropriate sentence depends not only upon its own facts but also upon the personal circumstances of the accused. The sentence to be imposed is not the appropriate sentence for the crime, but the appropriate sentence for the crime because it has been committed by that accused. The range of possible penalties is dependent upon those two factors. It is only when the penalty is below the range as determined on this basis that the question of undue leniency may be considered.” </font></i></p>
              </ul>

             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> “The first consideration in determining the sentence is the public interest, which is served not merely by punishing the offender and showing a deterrent to others, but also by affording a compelling inducement and an opportunity to the offender to reform. The punishment should be appropriate not only to the offence committed, but also to the particular offender.” </font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">9. In </font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2001] 3 I.R. 390, the Court of Appeal said:-</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> “If the term "undue leniency" were considered ambiguous or unclear, so that recourse could be had to parliamentary material, the "error in principle" approach would find support. The Minister for Justice, in introducing the measure said that before a sentence could be increased the trial judge "would have to have made a serious error, a serious breach of accepted principles of sentencing". </font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The onus of establishing undue leniency rests with the appellant (see </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">DPP v. Stronge</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2011] IECCA 79). It is insufficient to establish that a particular sentence is lenient or very lenient, it is necessary to establish that the sentence went beyond that, and was in fact unduly lenient. It is a high threshold because of the generally wide discretion that is afforded to a sentencing judge when imposing sentence. In circumstances where such sentence has been imposed following a full assessment of all relevant facts by the learned sentencing judge, and who had the benefit of hearing first hand the evidence from the prosecuting garda and the plea and mitigation. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. The victim of this very serious assault, Mr. Muldoon, sustained significant injuries. He suffered a broken jaw which required a number of medical procedures, a soft tissue injury to his leg and severe bruising to his head and face. He was unable to eat solid food for a week and continued to suffer headaches thereafter. He was required to use
