             <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Noonan delivered on the 3rd day of April, 2017</font></b> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. In the within motion, the defendant seeks an order dismissing the plaintiff&#x2019;s claim on the grounds that it is statute barred. The defendant alternatively seeks an order directing the trial of the same issue as a preliminary issue.</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Background Facts</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The plaintiff was involved in a road traffic accident on the 24th November, 2010, in Limerick City when he alleges that his stationary vehicle was rear-ended by the defendant&#x2019;s car. He claims to have suffered personal injuries as a result. The plaintiff is a taxi driver and suffers from dyslexia.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The plaintiff applied to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (&#x201c;the Board&#x201d;) for an assessment of his damages pursuant to s. 11 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 (&#x201c;the 2003 Act&#x201d;). He made the application by way of submitting a </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">pro forma</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> document known as &#x201c;Form A&#x201d; prescribed by the Board for the making of such applications. The document was completed by the plaintiff himself without legal advice or assistance. In the document, the plaintiff stated that the date of the accident was the 30th September, 2010. He signed the document and thereafter in the blank space proceeded by the word &#x201c;Date:&#x201d; he wrote &#x201c;Friday&#x201d;. The Form A document completed by the plaintiff was accompanied by a report from his general medical practitioner who completed another document prescribed by the Board known as &#x201c;Form B&#x201d; which is a template medical report.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. In this document, the plaintiff&#x2019;s G.P., in the box entitled &#x201c;Date of accident&#x201d; wrote: &#x201c;our records &#x2013; 24/11/10 his records &#x2013; 30/09/10&#x201d;. Both of these documents, which were received by the Board, were date stamped the 12th November, 2012, by the Board. By letter dated the 14th November, 2012, the Board wrote to the plaintiff in the following terms:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;Dear Mr. Healy</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In order to complete your claim we require additional information so that the time can stop running against the named respondent. You should be aware that the law only allows a limited time within which you can bring your personal injury claim (normally two years from the date of the accident), so it is important that you give this your urgent attention. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are unable to acknowledge your claim as complete until we receive the following:</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#xf0fc; Form A is incomplete. We return it for full completion and to assist we have highlighted the outstanding queries. </font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#xf0fc; As there is a discrepancy between the date of the incident on the Form A and that on the medical report card please confirm the correct date of incident&#x2026;.</font> </p>
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yours etc.&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">5. In response to this letter, the plaintiff re-submitted precisely the same Form A as previously submitted with the sole change that in the box entitled &#x201c;Date of injury/accident&#x201d; he struck through the previous date &#x201c;30/09/2010&#x201d; and substituted above it &#x201c;24/11/10&#x201d;.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. He returned the amended Form A to the Board who date stamped it the 20th November, 2012. At this juncture, the limitation period was due to expire four days later on 24th November, 2012. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. By letter of the 3rd December, 2012, containing the same </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">pro forma</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> first paragraph as the earlier letter, the Board wrote: </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;we are unable to acknowledge your claim as complete until we receive the following:</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#xf0fc; Form A is incomplete. We return it for full completion and to assist we have highlighted the outstanding queries. Kindly have the LAST page dated correctly &#x2026;&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">8. The emphasised sentence was a new addition from the previous letter. This letter was written after the expiry of the limitation period.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. Ultimately, an authorisation was issued by the Board on the 17th June, 2014, which stated that the date of the relevant claim was &#x201c;30/09/2010&#x201d;. Thereafter a plenary summons was issued on behalf of the plaintiff on the 5th December, 2014, which also stated erroneously that the date of the accident was 30th September, 2010. There is now no dispute about the date of the accident. The defendant contends that the accident occurred on 24th November, 2010, and the plaintiff agrees. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Arguments</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The defendant contends for two straightforward propositions. First, the defendant says that under the relevant legislation to which I shall refer, time does not stop running against the plaintiff for the purposes of the Statute of Limitations until an application is made to the Board. Such an application is only made when it has been received in a form specified in relevant Regulations and such receipt has been acknowledged in writing by the Board. In the present case, the correctly completed form was not received by the Board and acknowledged in writing by it as having been received within the limitation period and thus the claim is statute-barred. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. Secondly, the defendant contends that the authorisation issued in this case is valid only in respect of an accident that occurred on 30th September, 2010, and does not authorise the institution of any proceedings relating to an accident that occurred on 24th November, 2010, by consensus the correct date. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. The plaintiff by reference to the authorities to which I shall refer argued that an appropriately completed form as required by the rules was submitted within time, thus the application was made within time and the statute stopped on the date of receipt of that application being the 20th November 2010. On the authorisation point, the plaintiff argues that this is clearly a simple error by the Board in circumstances where it had originally been given the wrong date, this was corrected by the plaintiff but the authorisation was incorrectly issued by the Board without taking the later date into account. That can be amended simply by the issue of a fresh authorisation if necessary. The reference in the personal injuries summons to the earlier date is simply a repetition of the previous error and can be amended with no prejudice to the defendant. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Legislation</font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">13. Section 11 of the 2003 Act, insofar as relevant to this case, provides as follows:</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;11. &#x2013; (1) A claimant shall make an application under this section to the Board for an assessment to be made under s. 20 of his or her relevant claim.</font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">14. Section 50 of the 2003 Act provides:</font>

              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">15. The relevant rules were enacted by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Rules 2004 (S.I. 219 of 2004) (&#x201c;the Rules&#x201d;). Rule 3 insofar as relevant provides as follows:</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;3. (1) an application under s. 11 of the Act shall &#x2013;</font>

             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">16. Those documents include a pro forma medical report. Rule 3 (2) also requires that the application be accompanied by such charge as may be imposed by the Board.</font>

             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">18. On their face, the Rules confer what appear to be potentially quite draconian powers on the Board insofar as the computation of the limitation period in any particular claim is concerned. The Rules appear to suggest that a failure to comply with the Board&#x2019;s requirements in respect of any of the matters within its competence under the Rules can result in a plaintiff losing his or her right to bring a claim. Thus the Board has the power to require a claimant to provide any information it specifies and any document it or its staff considers relevant to the claim. Whilst these powers are discretionary under the Rules, they are not unfettered and must be exercised in a manner conforming to the requirements of constitutional justice.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Kiernan v. J. Brunkard Electrical Ltd</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2011] IEHC 448, the plaintiff was involved in an accident on the 11th June, 2007. On the 27th May, 2009, the plaintiff&#x2019;s solicitors faxed an application form, copy medical report and copy cheque to the Board. On the same date, the original documents were sent by registered post. The Board subsequently wrote to the plaintiff&#x2019;s solicitors confirming that the application was completed on the 29th May, 2009, presumably being the date when the originals were received. One of the central issues in the case was whether the application, for the purposes of the Statute of Limitations, was made on the 27th May, 2009, or the 29th May, 2009. In dealing with this point, White J. said:</font> </p>

               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In my opinion there is a conflict between the two. In construing when the claim was made the Court must have regard to the Act in preference to the Rules made pursuant to the Act. This is clear from the Case Law precedent.</font> </p>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2008] IEHC 368, the plaintiff was involved in a road traffic accident. The relevant limitation period expired on the 30th March, 2007. The plaintiff&#x2019;s solicitor posted the relevant documents to the Board by prepaid registered post on the 29th March, 2007. The evidence did not establish when the Board received those documents. The Board however issued an acknowledgment in writing on receipt of the documents which was dated the 2nd April, 2007, thus outside the limitation period. The defendant accordingly contended that the plaintiff&#x2019;s claim was statute barred. Dealing with this point, Dunne J. said (at p.6):</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The defendant however, contends that having regard to the provisions of Rule 3, sub-rule 3 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Rules 2004, the date of making of the application under s. 11 is 2nd April, 2007 being the date on which the application was acknowledged in writing as having been received by the Board.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If the contention on behalf of the defendant is correct, it would appear that the effect of Rule 3(3) of S.I. No. 219 of 2004 is that a plaintiff could be statute barred in circumstances entirely outside their control. Clearly, such a consideration could result in significant hardship for a plaintiff. Whilst one might be critical of a plaintiff for leaving the issue of proceedings or, in the case of personal injuries applications the making of an application under s. 11 until the last moment, nonetheless the Statute of Limitations 1957 has fixed a specific period within which to commence one&#x2019;s proceedings and it seems somewhat harsh, to say the least, that having taken every step that one can take in order to commence proceedings, that one could become statute barred by the actions of a third party over whom one has no control, in this case, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.&#x201d;</font></p>

             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">21. Dunne J. went on to say (at p.10):</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;I find it difficult to accept the argument of the defendant herein, that the plaintiff in these proceedings is statute barred by reason of the provisions of Rule 3, sub-rule 3 of S.I. No. 219 of 2004, in circumstances where the Oireachtas has fixed by statute the limitation period at 30th March, 2007. Having regard to the provisions of s. 7 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 and s. 26 of the Interpretation Act 2005, I cannot see how a plaintiff could find themselves statute barred in circumstances where they have made the necessary application to P.I.A.B. under s. 11 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, within time, by post, in circumstances where in the ordinary course of post, the application would have been in time. There is nothing before me to indicate that the application under s. 11 was not in fact delivered in the ordinary course of post. I do not see how the administrative act of affixing a date stamp on the application by P.I.A.B. can oust the statutory provisions in relation to the limitation period.</font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff herein is statute barred.&#x201d;</font></p>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">22. Accordingly, as can be seen from these two cases, the court was satisfied that
