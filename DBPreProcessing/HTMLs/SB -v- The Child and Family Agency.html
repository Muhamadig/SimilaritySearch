              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;The Applicant seeks in these proceedings to restrain the conduct of an investigation into certain information received and allegations made against him. A previous investigation into these matters was discontinued after certain issues were raised on behalf of the Applicant by his legal representatives. By letter dated September 7th, 2015, the Respondent indicated that it noted the Applicant&#x2019;s concerns regarding alleged breaches of natural justice and fair procedures and proposed to commence a fresh assessment of any outstanding allegations. A copy of detailed procedures which would govern the proposed assessment was enclosed. The letter also confirmed that any concluded assessments would not form part of the fresh assessment. No response was received from the Applicant prior to the making of an application for leave in these proceedings on October 21st, 2015. No further steps have been taken in respect of the proposed investigation following the initiation of these proceedings.&#x201d;</font>

             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. The background facts of this case are found in the statement of grounds.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. In September, 2007 a father (P.C.) of a pupil (A.C.) in the applicant&#x2019;s class complained about the applicant. This was followed by a letter from four male parents, including P.C., dated 8th October, 2007 to the parent representatives on the Board of Management complaining about the applicant. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. The board of management investigated the matter, the Chairman of the Board of Management wrote to P.C. by letter dated 10th March, 2008 confirming the matter was being addressed and dealt with. No further issue arose in relation to this complaint, after it had been investigated and determined. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. Just under seven years later, on 29th January, 2014, (unbeknownst to the applicant) Margo Fenton, a social work team leader with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency (herein &#x201c;the CFA&#x201d;) wrote to the school principal, stating that the CFA had recently received a number of referrals in relation to the applicant, concerning his treatment of children during the working day. She stated that she, Margo Fenton, and the principal social worker, Carmel Martin, would like to meet the Principal to discuss the contents of these referrals. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. On 13th March, 2014 the applicant was called into the office by the Principal and was advised of the CFA investigation. The Principal gave the applicant a letter dated 13th March, 2014 stating that he was &#x201c;obliged to inform you that I have now today received a visit from social workers with Tusla who inform me that they are currently involved in an ongoing investigation into significant emotional abuse allegations against you.&#x201d; He was informed that the allegations would be referred to the Gardaí. This Court notes that this was how the applicant became aware of the investigation, he was not contacted by the CFA. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. On 19th March, 2014, Ms. Fenton of the CFA wrote to the Principal. She confirmed details of the children who had made the referrals. There were three named children: A.C., whose father had complained in 2007; C.R.; and E.M.; and a fourth child whose parents had sought anonymity. Ms. Fenton referred to these four children giving &#x201c;what we deem credible accounts of intimidation and emotional abuse&#x201d;. Some, it was stated, were still very traumatised by the events. On 2nd April, 2014, Ms. Fenton wrote to the applicant, inviting him to meet her and proposing a date. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. On 7th April, Deirdre O&#x2019;Connor of the Irish National Teachers Organisation (herein &#x201c;INTO&#x201d;) wrote to Louise Coniry, the duty social worker, on 7th April, stating:&#x2014;</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;We wish to assure you that Mr. B is anxious to co-operate with Tusla and to meet at a mutually agreeable time but requires full information and documentation in advance of any meeting with Tusla.&#x201d;</font>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">Margo Fenton on 8th April, 2014, advised that the CFA would not correspond with the INTO representative and stated that they would only correspond with Mr. B directly on the matter. This Court opines that the INTO representative, Deirdre O&#x2019;Connor, would be someone well-versed in the duties of teachers and the role of the CFA, and no explanation has been given for Louise Coniry&#x2019;s refusal to deal with INTO.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the same day, 8th April, 2014, Margo Fenton wrote to the applicant stating a representative from INTO had contacted her office informing her that he would not be attending any meeting with the CFA. Some of the allegations were disclosed in summary form in this letter to the applicant; however, this was done without identifying any of the pupils who had made the allegations. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17. Deirdre O&#x2019;Connor wrote again on 22nd April, saying that she had been unsuccessful at her attempts to contact Ms. Fenton by telephone, referred to the relevant legal authorities and reiterated the requirement for particulars and documentation. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18. On 6th May, 2014, the Chairperson of the Board of Management of &#x201d;the school&#x201d; wrote to the applicant referring to the complaints set forth in the letter from the CFA of 19th March, 2014. Two further referrals had been made by the Principal in relation to M.D. and R,F. The Board invited the applicant to attend a board meeting on 13th May, 2014. On 7th May, the Principal gave the applicant copies of the enclosures, together with a letter from the Chairman, mainly the letter of 19th March (redacted), and the redacted standard report form in respect of S.D. and R.F. Eventually the applicant received unredacted versions of the enclosures from the Principal. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19. The applicant met with the Board of Management on the 13th May, 2014. The purpose of the meeting was to consider whether he should be put on administrative leave. He was subsequently informed that he would not be placed on administrative leave. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20. On 23rd May, 2014 the Principal wrote to Margo Fenton seeking an urgent update as to the current status of the CFA investigation. He pointed out that Tusla had refused to provide an opinion to the Board regarding administrative leave, and that ultimately the Board had decided not to place the applicant on administrative leave. He stated that the Board could propose to investigate the complaints that they were currently on notice of relating to current students (C.R., R.F. and S.D.) and asked whether Tusla/CFA wanted the Board of Management to defer its investigation pending the outcome of the Tusla/CFA investigation. He requested an &#x2018;urgent update&#x2019; regarding the current status of their investigations. </font> </p>

The Principal wrote on 4th June, 2014 to the applicant advising that he had received written confirmation that the investigation regarding the current students at the school, namely C,R,, R.F. and S.D., was concluded for now.

He advised that meetings would be held with the parents of C.R. and S.D. in respect of complaints against the applicant. the Chairman had sought urgent clarification from the parents as to whether they were alleging their children were subject to sexual abuse, as this was not set out in previous written complaints to the Board. He also referred to letters from P.C. to the school principal, alleging that images of naked men were shown to a pupil, C.B., by the applicant. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">29. On 31st July, 2014, the D parents wrote stating that at no stage had they ever suggested that S.D. and been sexually abused, groomed, physically abused or neglected in school: she had however been both psychologically and emotionally affected by the applicants behaviour. The R failed to provide a clear answer to the letter of the Chairman. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">30. By letter of 7th August, 2014, Margo Fenton wrote to the applicant stating that a further three children had made complaints to the CFA. The letter stated that the parents of E.T. and R.F. have declined to have their children interviewed, and that the concerns came to light through the children&#x2019;s parents. The complaints of the three children, E.T., R.F., and S.D. were summarised. Margo Fenton then advised the applicant to respond in person or in writing, and that if she did not hear directly from him, the CFA would conclude their assessment without his input and advise the Board of Management, the parents, and the Gardai accordingly. </font> </p>

On 15th August, Deirdre O&#x2019;Connor of INTO wrote expressing the applicant&#x2019;s denial of the allegations of mistreatment, and reiterated the request for information and documentation.

The letter noted that the CFA had not afforded the applicant with an opportunity to know what was being alleged against him and to respond.

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">36. On 4th March, 2015, Hayes solicitors wrote to Binchy solicitors, solicitors for the CFA, stating that none of the matters referred to in their previous letter of the 12th September, 2014, had been addressed or responded to, and that it was not good enough for the CFA to respond in such a dismissive way. Hayes repeated their request, that the CFA &#x2018;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">outline what is going on</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x2019;. They stated that the applicant was entitled to fair procedures, and to know the allegations.

             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">41. On 8th July, 2015, the respondent wrote to the applicant directly, the letter signed by Louise Coniry, social worker, and Sean Scanlon, social worker. The letter set out allegations of emotion and physical abuse which had been perpetrated by the applicant against seven pupils in his class. Under the heading &#x2018;Documentation&#x2019;, it is stated that attached to the letter by way of disclosure are the documents the CFA will rely upon in their assessment. She proposed dates to meet with the applicant. She then stated she would reach a provisional conclusion as to whether these allegations were founded or unfounded. There would be a further opportunity to respond and an appeal process. </font> </p>

             <ul>

              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c; (viii) It is denied that the Respondent has failed to adequately particularise the allegations of fact made against the Applicant. It is further denied that the Respondent has failed to adequately particularise the basis for the conduct of an assessment, as alleged.

The relevant orders of the Rules of the Superior Courts (Judicial Review), 2011 are contained in Regulation 22(4) and (5). Regulation 22(4) and (5) state:-</font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;(4) Any respondent who intends to oppose the application for judicial review by way of motion on notice shall within three weeks of service of the notice on the respondent concerned or such other period as the Court may direct file in the Central Office a statement setting out the grounds for such opposition and, if any facts are relied on therein, an affidavit, in Form No. 14 in Appendix T, verifying such facts, and serve a copy of that statement and affidavit (if any) on all parties. The statement shall include the name and registered place of business of the respondent&#x2019;s solicitor (if any). </font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(5) It shall not be sufficient for a respondent in his statement of opposition to deny generally the grounds alleged by the statement grounding the application, but the respondent should state precisely each ground of opposition, giving particulars where appropriate, identify in respect of each such ground the facts or matters relied upon as supporting that ground, and deal specifically with each fact or matter relied upon in the statement grounding the application of which he does not admit the truth (except damages, where claimed).&#x201d;</font></p>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">46. These rules were introduced in 2011 by amendment to the Rules of the Superior Courts. The Rules were amended specifically to require a party filing a statement of opposition (and thereby indicating its intention to defend the application) to identify the issues in the case, and to identify in respect of each ground, the facts or matters relied upon as supporting that ground, and to deal specifically with each fact or matter relied upon in the statement grounding the application of which he does not admit the truth. </font>

             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mootness/Prematurity of Proceedings </font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">47. The replying affidavit of Tara Downes, solicitor of the CFA, sworn on the 9th May, 2016 details the respondent&#x2019;s claim, that the applicant&#x2019;s case is one that is either premature, or moot. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">48. She sets out that a large portion of the applicant&#x2019;s statement of grounds concerns &#x201c;a previous investigation which was not finalised following concerns raised on behalf of the applicant. These matters are clearly moot in circumstances where a de novo investigation has been proposed. That is particularly so where the applicant has not identified any prejudice to the proposed investigation arising from the fact or conduct of a previous investigation.&#x201d;</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">49. At para. 10 of her affidavit of the 9th June, 2016, Miss Downes sets out that &#x201c;With regard to the plea of prematurity, I say that the various assertions made in respect of the proposed investigation cannot be sustained when nothing has yet occurred. I say and am advised that it is a long-standing principle that there is a presumption that investigations will be conducted in accordance with fair procedures and natural and constitutional justice. I further say and am advised that this has particular force where the Applicant has been provided with detailed procedures as to how the investigation will be conducted. I say that it is relevant in this regard that the Applicant has not identified a specific prejudice arising from any aspect of the proposed procedures but has simply omitted to refer to them in any detail in the allegations made or the correspondence exchanged.&#x201d;</font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Relevant Correspondence </font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">50. In a letter dated 23rd July, 2015, Carol Fawsitt of Hayes Solicitors wrote to Gordon Jeyes, Chief Executive of the CFA on behalf of the plaintiff. The letter set out the applicant&#x2019;s objections to the involvement of Miss Coniry, social worker, in any investigation. Miss Coniry had been involved in (what is termed) the &#x2018;previous&#x2019; investigation process concerning allegations made against the plaintiff, wherein a report of a concluded investigation was furnished to the plaintiff by Miss Coniry, he having not been afforded any opportunity to meet with the social workers before they came to their conclusions.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">51. This is contrary to the CFA&#x2019;s internal policy opened before the Court, which sets out that a person against whom complaints are made must be consulted prior to the completion of any report. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">52. Further, this letter set out that the plaintiff had received a letter from Miss Coniry dated the 8th July, 2015 informing the plaintiff that seven cases were being brought against him. The letter states that four of these cases are concluded, and questions why they are being reopened now, and pursued by the CFA. The social workers had communicated to the school&#x2019;s Board of Management that these four cases should be dealt with by the Board, by letter dated the 13th March, 2014. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">53. The letter requests that the CFA identify what allegations the applicant is being asked to address. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">54. In a letter dated the 7th September, 2015, in response to the letter written on behalf of the applicant dated the 23rd July, 2015, Tusla wrote to Hayes solicitors. The following was set out: </font> </p>
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201c;We note the concerns raised in your letters wherein you assert your client&#x2019;s rights to natural justice and fair procedures have been breached. </font> 
               <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Child and Family Agency now propose to commence a fresh assessment of any outstanding allegations against your client pursuant to the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Agency&#x2019;s Policy and Procedures for Responding to Allegations of Child Abuse </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">dated</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">September 2014 (&#x201c;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Policy and Procedures</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#x201d;) and enclose a copy for your attention.

             <br> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">55. This Court does not accord with the respondent&#x2019;s position, as to the mootness/prematurity of these proceedings. To assert that &#x201c;nothing has yet occurred&#x201d;, as set out in the affidavit of Tara Downes, contradicts the position of the CFA as set out in the letter dated the 7th September, 2015, wherein the CFA stated they did not propose to re-interview children, as this would be contrary to the children&#x2019;s best interests and in line with social work best practice. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">56. It appears from the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">correspondence</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, and not the affidavit evidence, that the de novo assessment will include reference to interviews obtained in what the CFA have themselves conceded was a flawed process. Nowhere is this plainly set out on affidavit. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">57. If these interviews obtained in the previous investigation are to be the subject of the de novo assessment, this should be set out clearly by the respondent on affidavit.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">58. Myriad letters were opened before the Court in an attempt to ascertain the respondent&#x2019;s position. Parties to actions must set out plainly their position in pleadings, for reasons explored below. </font><br> </p>
             <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Purpose of Pleadings </font></b><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana">59. As Finnegan P. set out in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Law Society of Ireland v.

If material from the previous, flawed investigation is to be utilised, this should be set out clearly on affidavit. Only then will the applicant know the case he has to answer, and effectively challenge the respondent&#x2019;s position. As Kelly J. stated in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">PJ Carroll &amp; Co v Minister for Health and Children</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2005] 1 IR 294: </font> </p>
