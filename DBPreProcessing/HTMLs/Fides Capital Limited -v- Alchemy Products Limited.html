              <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I. Overview</font></b>
             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This is an application for security for costs brought in the context of a case for, inter alia, specific performance or damages, pursuant to an alleged breach of contract. </font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The plaintiff and defendant are Irish-registered companies. According to its statement of claim, the plaintiff was retained by the defendant to provide professional services to Renewable Energy Dynamic Holdings Limited (‘RedH’) for the benefit of RedH’s shareholders, including the defendant. An argument has arisen between the parties over the remuneration owing to the plaintiff, with the plaintiff relying in particular on cl. 3.3 of a ‘Financial Advisory/Executive Services Agreement’ dated 12th August, 2010, and signed by two individuals ostensibly acting for the plaintiff and defendant respectively. Under cl. 3.3 of that purported agreement (it is denied by the defendant that the agreement was entered into on the terms alleged or at all), remuneration falls to be calculated as a percentage of funds raised/consideration arising in the course of an anticipated funding processes. If the plaintiff is successful at trial, this arrangement has the potential to provide it with a lucrative return on such work as it claims to have done for the defendant.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. The specific reliefs sought in the notice of motion are: (1) an order pursuant to s.52 of the Companies Act 2014 directing the plaintiff to provide security for the defendant’s costs; (2) further, or in the alternative, an order pursuant to O.29, r.1 of the Rules of the Superior Courts 1986, as amended, that the plaintiff furnish security for the defendant’s costs; (3) an order measuring the security to be given by the plaintiff for the defendant’s costs and the form thereof; (4) an order staying the within proceedings until such time as security for costs is provided by the plaintiff; and (5) certain ancillary reliefs. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. By way of guiding case-law, the court proposes to rely upon </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Connaughton Road Construction Limited v. Laing O’Rourke Ireland Limited </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2009] IEHC 7, as well as such other case-law as is referred to below. Those cases, applied in the context of the within proceedings, require the court firstly to determine whether (i) the defendant has established a </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> defence, and (ii) the plaintiff is so financially challenged that it will not be able to pay the defendant’s costs, if the defendant is successful.</font><br> </p>

              <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">II. Prima Facie Defence?</font></b>
             </div> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. As to whether the defendant has established a </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> defence, the defendant maintains, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, that what it claims is but a purported agreement of 12th August, 2010, (a) was entirely contingent on the completion of a then proposed purchase of RedH by Enervest Capital Limited, and that (b) as that transaction did not proceed, cl. 3.3 is of no effect. There was what has been described in an e-mail of 6th July last written by Mr McCann (a director and, it seems, the prime mover within the plaintiff) an arrangement referred to by him as the “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">roll-in</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” arrangement which, it seems, he points to as the relevant transaction by which the percentage fee amount that he maintains to be owing under cl.3.3 falls now to be calculated. One or more expert witnesses will be called by the defendant at trial to contest that the “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">roll-in</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” arrangement offers a sound basis on which to invoke cl.3.3. </font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. The court considers that in circumstances where (a) a defendant denies a contract to exist, (b) maintains that, if the contract exists, the events necessary for a clause to take effect have not in fact occurred, and (c) intends to call expert evidence that is supportive of proposition (b), that defendant has established a </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> defence. Whether that defence will ultimately succeed is not, of course, a matter on which the court offers or holds any view.</font><br> </p>
             <div align="center">
              <br> 
              <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">III. Inability to Meet Defendant’s Costs?</font></b>
             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">7. It does not appear to be seriously contested that the plaintiff </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">is </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">so financially challenged that it will not be able to pay the defendant’s costs, if the defendant is successful. Were the contrary to be contested, there is nothing in the plaintiff’s most recent publicly filed financial statements to suggest that it would be able to meet the costs of what looks likely at this time to be a 3-4 day trial, the costs of which will run to the hundreds of thousands of euro. (The defendant estimates that the party and party costs likely to be recoverable by it in the event that it is the eventual victor in these proceedings would be €274,500). The plaintiff, if one has regard to its latest filed accounts, does not have the funds to pay such a sum. There is, it is fair to note, a time-gap between the year to which the plaintiff’s latest filed annual accounts relate and the present. However, if there has been some sea-change in the plaintiff’s fortunes since those latest accounts were filed, and it is not suggested that there has, no evidence of this has been placed before the court.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. By letter of 13th March, Mr McCann has offered a personal guarantee for the defendant’s costs in the amount of €91,667. However, it seems to the court that there are at least two difficulties with the proposed personal guarantee arrangement. First, even if the court were minded to factor the personal guarantee arrangement into its considerations, no evidence of Mr McCann’s personal financial position, and hence his ability to make payment under the guarantee, has been placed before the court. Second, the offer of a personal guarantee runs against the basic thrust of a security for costs application which, simply put, is ‘if plaintiff company loses, plaintiff company can generally be expected to be liable for costs, and plaintiff company will have granted security for costs’; that is a very different proposition from ‘if plaintiff company loses, plaintiff company can generally be expected to be liable for costs and, although plaintiff company has not granted security for costs, a portion of them may be recoverable from a third party who will need to be sued separately on his guarantee in the event that he does not pay upon demand.’ </font> </p>

              <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">IV. Specific Circumstances Justifying Not Making the Orders Now Sought?</font></b>
             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">9. The court finds, for the reasons stated above, that the defendant has established a </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> defence to the within proceedings and an inability on the part of the plaintiff to meet the defendant’s likely costs. The onus therefore falls on the plaintiff to show that there are specific circumstances in the case which ought to cause the court to exercise its discretion not to make the order sought. The plaintiff company points, in effect, to two special circumstances: first, that its impecuniosity is due to the alleged wrongdoing of the defendant; second, it seems, that the offer of the personal guarantee is a special circumstance. As to the second point, it seems to the court to fail for the reasons identified previously above as to the general unsuitability of the proposed personal guarantee arrangement. As to the first point, there is no trading history before the court to justify the claim that other valuable work could have been done in lieu of the work done for the defendant. Moreover, while time expended on work cannot be measured simply by reference to amount of paper generated thereby, it is perhaps of note that the amount of work purported to have been done by the plaintiff thus far can be contained within three A4 folders that sat easily on counsels’ desk in the course of the hearing of the within application, a fact which is possibly suggestive of an availability for that other work of which there is no trading history to suggest has gone undone because of the workload imposed by the defendant.</font>

             <font size="2" face="Verdana">10. Having regard to the foregoing, the court will order security for costs. But what is the quantum of security to be ordered? And does the omission of the word “</font>
