              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) Overview.</font></p>
             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Butler Homes Limited is the respondent to the within proceedings. It is not represented by any legal advisors. The reason it is not represented, it is asserted by Mr Michael Butler, a director of the company, is because it does not possess the necessary funds to pay for professional legal fees, and its board and shareholders do not possess the necessary resources to put the company in sufficient funds to afford professional legal representation. Mr Butler attended in court when the within application came on for hearing and sought to speak for the company; however, counsel for the applicant contended that Mr Butler, as a director of the company, had no right to be heard. The position, with respect, is not quite so stark. The Court of Appeal’s recent decision in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Allied Irish Banks plc v. Aqua Fresh Fish Limited</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2017] IECA 77 makes this clear. There the Court of Appeal held that the longstanding rule identified by the Supreme Court in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Battle v. Irish Art Promotion Centre Ltd</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1968] IR 252 still applies, albeit that, following the decision of the Supreme Court in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the Matter of Applications for Orders in Relation to Costs in Intended Proceedings by Stella Coffey and Others</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2013] IESC 11, in exceptional circumstances a trial judge may depart from the rigours of the rule in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Battle</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">. Although the decision in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Aqua Fresh Fish</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana"> issued after the hearing of the within application, it represents precedent that is binding on this Court and also offers a useful prism through which to view the longstanding decision of the Supreme Court in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Battle </font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">and its more recent decision in </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Coffey</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The judgment in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Aqua Fresh Fish</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> helpfully examines the rationale for the rule in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Battle</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in some detail. It indicates that that rule: is anchored in the legal personality of a company; and proceeds on the rationale that as the incorporation of an incorporated entity is a voluntary decision, those who regulate their business activities in such a manner have to accept the consequences of same. It might, perhaps not unreasonably, be contended by some that it does not follow as a logical consequence of this proposition (as opposed to a consequence of the rules of precedent that bound the Court of Appeal in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Aqua Fresh Fish</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and which bind this Court in the within proceedings) that a company or other corporation should not be capable of being represented in civil proceedings by, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">e.g.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, a director who is not a practising legal professional, if such person has been authorised by the company or corporation to appear on its behalf and the trial court permits it. Indeed, as was acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Aqua Fresh Fish</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the current civil procedure rules in both England and Northern Ireland expressly allow such an arrangement, albeit that the Court of Appeal was able to identify two English cases which suggest that the granting of such permission may remain uncommon in England. The reason separate legal personality is considered to have the logical consequence aforesaid, apart from being the result, ultimately, of (a) the binding decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Battle</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, as modified by </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Coffey</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, and (b) the consequential effect of the rules of precedent, might therefore be contended by some, and perhaps not unreasonably, to be attributable to a choice of logic. The discussion in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Aqua Fresh Fish</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of self-representation by humans and the role of so-called </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">McKenzie </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">friends points to one rationale, perhaps the pre-eminent rationale, why the logic-choice made in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Battle </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was settled upon, being the practical difficulties that self-representation is perceived by some to yield as regards the efficient despatch of court proceedings. But while courts possibly may be better able to administer justice fairly and efficiently when all sides are represented by legal professionals, it might, perhaps not unreasonably, be contended by some that it is inimical to the proper administration of justice that (a) a defendant company should face going unheard from in proceedings to which it is party and where its interests stand to be affected adversely, simply because (b) that company and its shareholders and directors cannot afford the substantial funds necessary to engage the services of professional legal advisors on a prolonged basis. A legal system that, in the context under consideration, chooses to favour a logic which, in its practical effect, favours the richer over the poorer, renders itself open to due criticism; and there is also the point, to which the Court of Appeal in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Aqua Fresh Fish</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> draws attention, in its reference to the Opinion of Lord Clarke in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform v. UK Bankruptcy Limited</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2010] CSIH 80, that there may well be force in the observation that the strict application of a Battle-like rule, in particular in circumstances where a company is genuinely unable to pay for representation and has a </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">prima facie</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> valid claim or defence which cannot be vindicated, could be incompatible with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Whether the discretionary exercise of judicial pragmatism in this context is sufficient to meet adequately such practical concerns as present for impecunious companies owned and/or operated by impecunious individuals, or whether a more formalised approach akin to that which operates at this time in England and Northern Ireland is to be preferred, is a point on which reasonable people may perhaps reasonably differ, though this Court admits that it finds much to attract it in the current English and Northern Irish approach.</font> </p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Circumstances akin to those touched upon by Lord Clarke in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">UK Bankruptcy Limited</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> were contended to present in the within proceedings; however, there was not sufficient evidence before the court for it to conclude that they did in fact present. In consequence, the court had to proceed on the basis that there were not those “</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">exceptional circumstances</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">” referred to, inter alia, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Aqua Fresh Fish</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (echoing the decision of the Supreme Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Coffey</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">) that would justify the court in allowing a departure from the rigours of the rule in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Battle</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. As a result, in the within case, counsel for the applicant read out the entirety of the affidavit evidence sworn by Mr Michael Butler and sought to present all of the issues arising as fairly as he could without compromising his professional responsibilities towards his own client. This would be something of an ethical ‘tight-rope walk’ for any counsel. At the hearing of the within application that tight-rope was carefully and properly traversed by counsel for the applicants, who also helpfully addressed the brief couple of points that Mr Butler politely but persistently insisted on making at the hearing. The foregoing was the best that could be done in the circumstances, by reference, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, to such binding precedent as the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Aqua Fresh Fish</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (in which the Court of Appeal was itself bound by the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Battle</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">). Even so, the court must admit that it has the dissatisfying impression that the binding rule in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Battle</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (as modified in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Coffey</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">) is, in practice, failing small, cash-strapped companies whose directors and shareholders are likewise cash-strapped, and all by reference to logic that appears not to be unassailable, from which there have been departures in other jurisdictions and which, at least in the circumstances canvassed by Lord Clarke in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">UK Bankruptcy Limited</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, may yet be found, in a suitable case, to be incompatible with Art. 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</font><br> </p>

              <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">II. The Substance of the Within Application</font></b> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) Background.</font></p>
             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">4. The applicant firm of solicitors represented Butler Homes Limited in respect of the compulsory acquisition by Limerick City Council of certain of the company’s lands and was retained at all material times by Butler Homes Limited in arbitration proceedings between company and council in which the purchase price of the lands was determined, resulting in an award on 24th November, 2011, of, </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">, €110k to Butler Homes Limited. An award of costs was also made against Limerick City Council in favour of Butler Homes Limited; unfortunately a further dispute has arisen between the parties as to the nature of the costs that may be sought of Limerick City Council, with the applicant firm claiming that less costs may be claimed in this regard than Butler Homes Limited considers may properly be recovered. The applicant firm now comes to court seeking, </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">, (1) a declaration that the applicant firm is entitled to payment and receipt of the said costs, (2) a declaration that the applicant firm is entitled to a charge over the said costs, and (3) such order or orders as to the court appears just and proper for the raising and payment of the said costs. There was some mention at the hearing of the within application that there may be a certain urgency to the within application on the basis that as the arbitration issued on 24th November, 2011, the award of costs thereunder may soon become statute-barred. However, the award issued under seal, a 12-year limitation period thus applies by virtue of s.23 of the Arbitration Act 2010 and s.11(5)(b) of the Statute of Limitations 1957 (as amended) and so the expiry of the applicable limitation period is as yet some years hence.</font>
             <br> 
             <div align="center">
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) Allegations Made but never Proven.</font>
             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">5. In his affidavit evidence before the court in the within application, Mr Butler alleges that Butler Homes Limited never saw these award monies, with such monies as were received being used by the applicants to settle outstanding legal fees without authority. These are among the most serious allegations that one could make of a legal professional and it is extremely important to note that such allegations of misbehaviour as are made by Mr Butler in this regard are but allegations: they have never been established, they may never be established, they may in fact be completely untrue. Mr Dundon is considerably aggrieved by what has been alleged in this regard, and in his affidavit evidence avers, </font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">, that “</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">I take grave exception to the completely unfounded and untrue allegation made by Mr Butler that either I or this firm unlawfully took [any monies]…without any agreement or permission from the Respondent</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">.” He also points to the fact that Mr Butler’s allegation has, it seems, already been investigated and rejected by the Law Society, which body rightly treats alleged solicitor transgressions in respect of client funds with the utmost seriousness.</font> 
             <p><br> </p>
             <div align="center">
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) ‘No Foal, No Fee’ Arrangement.</font>
             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">6. One notable feature of the within application is that it is acknowledged by the applicant firm that it and all persons engaged in the arbitration acted on a ‘no foal, no fee’ (or contingency fee) basis. No details of this arrangement have been furnished to the court in evidence. In general, such an agreement has the effect that a client: (a) if successful, will be liable for (i) solicitor fees, (ii) expert fees, and (iii) outlays; and (b) if unsuccessful, will be liable for (i) expert fees, (ii) outlays, and (iii) usually, the costs of the winning side. But anything lawful can be agreed in contract law and, despite adjourning matters briefly to facilitate the applicants in this regard, no affidavit evidence has been placed before the court as to what was agreed by the applicant firm and/or such other persons as were engaged in the proceedings that have led to the within application; and no copy of the ‘no foal, no fee agreement’ has been exhibited. One slight difficulty that this presents in the within application is that it is not clear that the entirety of the fees over which the s.3 charge is sought are fees owing to the solicitor. </font>
             <br> 
             <div align="center">
              <br> 
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) Section 3 of the Act of 1876.</font>
             </div>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">7. The within application is made under s.3 of the Legal Practitioners (Ireland) Act, 1876, and s.21(7) of the Arbitration Act 2010 (which latter provision applies s.3 of the Act of 1876 to arbitration proceedings as though an arbitration were a proceeding in the High Court, with the High Court given the power to make declarations and orders accordingly). Section 3 of the Act of 1876 provides as follows:</font> 
             <ul> 
              <ul>
               <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">“In every case in which an attorney or solicitor shall be employed to prosecute or defend any suit matter or proceeding in any court of justice, it shall be lawful for the court or judge before whom any such suit matter or proceeding has been heard or shall be depending to declare such attorney or solicitor entitled to a charge upon the property recovered or preserved; and upon such declaration being made such attorney or solicitor shall have a charge upon and against and a right to payment out of the property, of whatsoever nature tenure or kind the same may be, which shall have been recovered or preserved through the instrumentality of any such attorney or solicitor, for the taxed costs, charges, and expenses of or in reference to such suit matter or proceeding; and it shall be lawful for such court or judge to make such order or orders for taxation of and for raising and payment of such costs charges and expenses out of the said property as to such court or judge shall appear just and proper; and all conveyances and acts done to defeat or which shall operate to defeat such charge or right shall, unless made to a bon� fide purchaser for value without notice, be absolutely void and of no effect as against such charge or right: Provided always, that no such order shall be made by any such court or judge in any case in which the right to recover payment of such costs, charges, and expenses is barred by any Statute of Limitations.”</font></i>
              </ul> 
             </ul> 
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">8. No case-law concerning s.3 of the Act of 1876 was placed before the court. However, although s.3 speaks of property “</font>
             <i><font size="2" face="Verdana">recovered or preserved</font></i>
             <font size="2" face="Verdana">” and not just property to which, for example, a legal right has been established by way of an order for costs such as that made by the arbitrator in favour of Butler Homes Limited against Limerick City Council, the court happens itself to be aware of, and is of course boun
